Dr. Chintamani Nagesa Ramachandra Rao, widely known as C.N.R. Rao, is a towering figure in the realm of chemistry, particularly celebrated for his pioneering contributions to solid-state and structural chemistry. Born on June 30, 1934, in Bangalore, India, Rao's relentless pursuit of knowledge made him the most influential chemist of our era.

In the summer of 2024, I got a chance to intern at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), an institute founded by Prof. Rao himself. Every morning, on my way to my lab, which was located on the 2nd floor of the International Centre Of Material Sciences (ICMS), I used to pass by Prof. Raoâ€™s cabin. I was taken aback by his unwavering commitment to coming to the workplace every day by 9:15 am despite being 89 years old and having health issues lately- he could have been sitting at home enjoying his retirement after achieving everything on his path, but he is built differently.

Prof. Rao's academic journey is nothing short of remarkable. He earned his Ph.D. from Purdue University and later conducted postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley. His career has been adorned with numerous prestigious positions, including serving as the Head of the Department of Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Currently, he holds the position of National Research Professor and Linus Pauling Research Professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore, which he himself had founded.

CNR Rao's dedication to science extends beyond his groundbreaking research. He served not only as a trusted advisor to the Prime Minister of India for two terms (2004-2014 & 1985-1989) through his role as Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Council, but also championed science on a global scale as President of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS).  His leadership also extends within India, where he founded and continues to lead both the Chemical Research Society and the Materials Research Society, demonstrating his commitment to fostering scientific progress.
