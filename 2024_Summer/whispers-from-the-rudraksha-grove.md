<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">In whispers soft, the rudraksha grove,<br>
My heart surrenders, filled with Shiva's love. <br>
Beneath the canopy of ancient green, <br>
Where dappled sunlight paints a sacred scene, <br>
I close my eyes and breathe the tranquil air, <br>
His presence lingers, a whispered prayer.<br>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Oh, Shiva, wrapped in robes of starry night,<br>
Your crescent moon, a beacon burning bright.<br>
Your throat, adorned with poison's stain, <br>
Embraces darkness, eases mortal pain.<br>
The Ganges flows, from matted locks unbound,<br>
A cleansing stream, on sacred ground.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">I hear the rhythm of Your damaru's beat, <br>
A primal pulse, a heartbeat bittersweet. <br>
The Tandava's echo, a cosmic dance, <br>
Of endings woven into new romance.<br>
Destroyer, yet from ashes, life takes hold, <br>
Your paradox unfolds, a story told.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">In meditations deep, on Himalayan snow,<br>
You conquer death, the secrets You bestow. <br>
The third eye opens, wisdom's fiery gaze,<br>
Burns through illusion, lights the hidden ways.<br>
Your form adorned with serpents, cold and wise,<br>
Reflects the cycle, where life and death arise.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Oh, Shiva, Lord of Mountains, fierce and wild, <br>
Within Your stillness, a power reconciled.<br>
You dwell in graveyards, where bones reside,<br>
A fearless spirit, in You I confide. <br>
Your cosmic dance, a whirlwind's raging might, <br>
Dissolves the darkness, brings eternal light.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">My love for You, a river deep and vast,<br>
Flows ever onward, forever meant to last. <br>
Through trials faced, and shadows I may see, <br>
Your calming presence sets my spirit free. <br>
In whispered mantras, Your name I sing, <br>
A sacred offering, the joy it brings.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Like pilgrims walking to Kailasha's peak,<br>
My soul yearns closer, Your solace I seek. <br>
With offerings of bel leaves, pure and white,<br>
I paint my devotion, bathed in morning light. <br>
The scent of incense, a prayer on the breeze, <br>
Carries my love across the ancient trees.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Oh, Shiva, Nataraja, dancer of the spheres,<br>
Weaving creation, dispelling worldly fears. <br>
May I embody Your serenity and grace, <br>
Find inner peace within this sacred space. <br>
Let compassion flow, like Ganga's gentle tide,<br>
Wash over anger, where love can reside.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">In whispers soft, the rudraksha grove replies,<br>
Your love for Shiva, forever in his eyes. <br>
With every breath, and every beat of heart, <br>
His presence lingers, a divine work of art. <br>
So rest here, beloved, in this tranquil shade,<br>
With Shiva's love, your spirit unafraid.<br>
