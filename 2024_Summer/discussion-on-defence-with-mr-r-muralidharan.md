R. Muralidharan, currently working for Tata Power as the Chief Technical Officer, is a well-known Indian expert in defence systems with extensive experience in producing high-quality missile defence solutions. He has made significant contributions to the development of Indian defence technology, particularly in missile defence and imaging radar systems. Some of his notable works include the development of the Indian Navy's Aegis system and the Multi-Function Radar (MFR) system for the Indian Army's Integrated Guided Missile Defence (IGMD) system. R. Muralidharan holds several patents and has received numerous awards for his contributions to the field.

In this interview, he talks to Udaan about the evolution of India’s defence technology, the projects he has led, the new trends in the industry, and the skills that the students are expected to possess in today’s world. He is undoubtedly a truly revolutionary figure and a guiding light for many; read on and get inspired!

When asked to throw some light onto “The evolution of India’s defence technology landscape over the years,” R. Muralidharan said :

> “India is still the largest importer of weapon systems. Right? We are the largest importer in the world even today. I'm talking about running 2023 statistics.”

He mentioned that, because of British rule, we were not left with such a good industry base to develop everything.

> “Slowly and gradually, we are moving to our own manufacturing, instead of importing. In the next 5 to 10 years, we should become self-sufficient. We should be exporting. And for a large economy like us, it is the difference in exports that are going to be really changing the economy.”

He further also mentioned that the developments in defence technologies have dual use, they can be used in civilian laws. As an example, the communication systems that are now a responsibility of the civil services were drawn in from the military. Moreover, now private companies are participating in this matter, he expressed his surety about India’s position as a global leader in defence manufacturing and exporting.

> “So with these private companies participating, the government allowing the synergies to happen. And I'm sure in a few years, we'll be a very advanced defence manufacturing and exporting country.” 

Finally, he added that the technologies that will be brought in are going to raise the quality of life of the common man as a result of the economical advancements and the number of jobs it would create.

Moving on, when requested to elaborate on some of the ground-breaking projects he has led as a critical figure in Tata Advanced Systems Limited, R. Muralidharan chose to start with the ATAX - Advanced Towed Artillery System. He said:

> "We have a strong collaborative academia, and we work with DRDO, and we work with the defence services to understand their requirements and how to do things."

Talking about the ATAX project, he said,

> "Gun systems are normally very classic gun systems. Simple ones have a lot of safety issues because they can create safety hazards for the crew, operating crew. In the case of ATAX, we have tried to make it a really advanced technology incorporated system. We call it a software defined gun."

He explained that there are a lot of sensors in play here, so if something ever goes wrong, they would be able to sense it ahead of time and stop the functioning of the gun. This minimizes the hazards and risks that such a gun can pose to the crew members. He continued:

> "Second, it's very accurate. Very consistently accurate. There's no collateral damage. Earlier when you would fire something, you had to keep firing around it assuming that something would get hit. Here, you can exactly hit the target. You can only hit the target and not anything else."

Furthermore, talking about the compact management system that he developed for the Indian Navy’s first aircraft carrier, he said:

> "It's a command and control system for the aircraft carrier. It's a very advanced system. Very, totally indigenously developed. So we are able to modify it based on Indian requirements. Earlier, we had to buy somebody's system and leverage it. Here, we are developing it ourselves, so we are able to adapt it and modify it according to the requirements of the services. And it may change over a period of time after they use it for 2, 3 years.”

He said that since they possess all-round knowledge about the systems they develop, they can adapt it to the requirements as time goes on. Moreover, being totally software-defined, they are able to change the software easily.

Further, we asked, how are the new-born fields of artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning really applicable to defence and combat systems? Do they have a role to play?

He agreed with us that AI, machine learning, and generative AI are some fields that will influence every walk of life and not just defence. AI seems to be a ground-breaking invention, after all!

R. Muralidharan explained the whole process of using and training machine learning models in a very understandable way. He said:

> “The training data for the model is very important. So the right thing to do is, first, collect the training data. Then tag it with the context, etcetera. Then use them for training a model for assembly in the combat management system. Right? So in the current CMS, we are putting data logging in context. We'll collect all data and log in what action was taken and what the situation is. So those data, maybe 2 years later, we use it.”

As if everything is not crystal clear already, he continues:

> “We use it for upgrading these CMS with machine learning models. Which will be trained on this. Second, where our data is not available, we also are able to simulate the data by some simulation technique. 
>
> With all of our understanding, we'll submit it and then use that simple data to train and order. The Indian defence is very upbeat about adopting AI, they themselves are adopting AI wherever they can. There was a committee formed to define what they should do. So they have a road map. So, and every different PSU - (Public Sector Undertaking) in the industry is also following that. There's a lot of adoption of newer technology in India.”

And thus, he gave us a total inside-out of how the whole machine learning model training actually happens! Further, if that wasn’t enough, he was more than happy to introduce a brand new AI concept called ‘Edge AI” talking about Edge AI, he said:

> “If you look at generative AI, large language models, they need huge compiling power. Now weapons stuff like a gun, I cannot run that. So there's a concept called edge AI. So what they're trying to bring in is the Edge AI interference system. It's a learning model trained specifically for a particular domain. It won't be able to do everything else in the world. Okay. Just that, just that- so the concept of Edge AI is what we are trying to bring into the weapons system. Maybe at the backend, we can use a generative model. Okay. We can use a server and Internet probably.”

He added, If we are sailing and there is some problem, we might not have the internet connection required to solve the problem, and this is where Edge AI comes into the picture!
Edge AI really sounds like a world-class improvement to the already existing Artificial Intelligence technology.

Moving on, defence is all about the safety of the country and its citizens and instilling in the minds of the citizens a certain sense of security; but what about the safety and security of the defence systems and the crew operating it? That’s exactly what we asked him:

*“So, sir, as trustworthiness and security is something you cannot leave out when it comes to these kind of defence systems, how does India ensure the reliability and resilience of these indigenous technologies in the defence industry, especially in the face of evolving threats?”*

He was very impressed by the question and said:

> “Security of systems is very important. In the military, there's a concept called net-centric warfare. That means all weapon systems are networked. So one weapon system is not independently functioning. We have a Network and a server and there is a radar and there is a chain of events that are happening. Somebody's observing. Somebody's acting. The sensor is there and the shooter is there, the shooter is the gun or a rocket system which has to work in synchronization. So there is a network of systems from radar to sensor to shooter - the gun, to tank, you name it. Right? So your security issue becomes a big issue. Security is a big issue when it's a network system and somebody can hack it. And, so there's a concept called SecOps.”

Now SecOps might sound like something straight out of a sci-fi movie, but it just stands for “Security and Operations”, it's a method of connecting the operations team and a security team in a manufacturing unit.

> “Right from the beginning, can we develop a secure system? Once you develop each model, can you check its security by trying to hack into it, by discovering these vulnerabilities. And then as you build up gradually, look at more and more of the security operands. So we are very much aware of this.”

He further went on to cite a book by Paul Scharre called “Army of None”. Apparently, this book gives us a comprehensive approach to dealing with the security of defence systems “*right from the module level.*”

> “However secure the system, the enemy can find a loophole. But lot of design aspects and sources and computing power and software is put into making it secure. You know a gun system, when you are talking to the command system someone can give a wrong command "Fire here!" and fire there may mean you are firing on your own friends! So we have to be very careful. And, there are techniques, technology involved in how to, you know, do a fencing of your system; for example, what we communicate with the external world is not hard to intercept. When I am communicating nobody can find out that I am communicating, so there are so many techniques and technologies involved in a network environment. So your company is not operating in isolation, it is operating in synchronization with a lot of other things. So all those things have been taken care of. Being aware of my own technology matters.”

All of this might sound scary at first, but problems do have solutions. He explained how they test and develop the security of the systems to be able to deal with breaches, hacks and security infringement.

> “Tomorrow if I'm buying a Russian system. They could have a loophole. They call it a backdoor. Where our date will be sent to them, what we are doing. We cannot find out. This is another important reason why we should have our own weapon system. So security is not a simple word, it is how we contribute to the concept of trustworthiness. If I have a computer, if I have a system, is it trustworthy?
>
> So it's built on so many checks and balances. Right? So we are developing trustworthy solutions, which can be secure for everybody. And the trustworthiness is at various levels and, so it's being improved. And then we also call ethical hackers; after we make a system, we give it to a set of hackers. They try to break into it. They're ethical hackers. They're well trained to hack. They're trying to see that they can break in . Sometimes they break in and then we fix that.”

Our next question to him was about academics:

*“So could you please talk about, like, the significance between, the collaboration between academia, industry, and the government while developing and driving advancements in this sector?”*

The academia and the industry of a country are the two pillars of development. Nothing can go right if they don't learn to work hand in hand. The skillset of the academia put together with the manufacturing technology of the industry is what can get the development and economy of a country really high. Having said that, R. Muralidharan had so much to say about the question asked:

> “The industry can think of a product. But basic out of the box thinking and research innovation comes from academia. I will give you an example, you have your GPS which is there on your phone also, GPS users use a very advanced concept called time dilation. When Albert Einstein talked about time dilation, nobody thought it had practical use. So this is a simple example to say that basic science starts from basic science research. We need to get into manufacturing, quality manufacturing. Big process. So academia, out of the box thinkers, science thinkers, all of them are required to come to a technology solution.”

In today’s ever-evolving world, we are building a lot of new technology, Artificial Intelligence being one of the most impressive. However, according to him, when a country has developed technology, it should also possess a strong academia. This is simply because most of the research in the world comes from academia. Converting the fundamental research into a product is the industry’s job.

As we know, any academic, technological, or industrial feat in the world is built upon many hurdles and setbacks, which brings us to our next question:

*“Sir, what are the major hurdles and challenges right now, especially for defence in the private sector?”*

> “Today the private sector is strong in manufacturing. But what to manufacture? Technology, for that, is being developed only by DRDO. Otherwise, we're importing it. Private sector’s challenge is that we don't have a ready-made technology available to manufacture and they order for that.“

We know that just like economic growth, demographics, and technological advancements, the defence sector is also a big indicator of a country’s power. Hence, the question:

*“Sir, so how do you see the future of India's defence technology? How long do you think it would take to come to where the other countries are right now?”*

To which, he confidently said that in just 5 to 10 years, we can start exporting.

> “Luckily for us, main systems are getting somewhat defined, new technologies are coming, we are getting at par with them. And we are a very young demography. Good learners.
>
> So we should be able to learn more than them quicker. Doesn't have to wait for so many years. They took 10 years to do something. We can do it in 2 years. We have a base; we can improve on it quickly.”

To back his statement, he used the example of ATAX. He said:

> “Nobody thought that guns were important, but we thought guns were important because they're cheaper to operate than a missile or rocket. So we invested. We are the private investor. It’s giving results.”

Coming to the more relevant question:

*”Sir, where do you see IITs fitting into this entire picture of academia research and the government initiatives?"*

IITs and IISERs being the premier institutes of technology in India, are expected to raise and train bright minds to contribute to technology which directly helps in the greater good of the nation. R Muralidharan agreed to this and said:

> “For example, today, the gun system. We charge, blow it up, it goes away, tomorrow this electromagnetic gun, it doesn't have any explosives, like your camera it doesn't have a film, no chemicals present. Same way, an electromagnetic gun doesn't have chemicals. 
> Right? So there are so many developments required in the defence industry.”

Having said this, the IISERs and the IITs, with the government supporting them, can contribute to the advancements using the knowledge that they gain.
However, he also mentions a certain kind of challenge the private sector might face:

> “The challenge in India I think is that private industry thinks that they should (get something); they are used to getting ready made technologies, they think IITs will give them ready-made technology, it's not like that. 
>
> It is the industry that has to change its mindset. IITians do not want to spend a lot of time on how to manufacture a quantum computer, they can only give the concept. They'll give you the concepts. You have to equally contribute in it and manufacture it.”

That brought Udaan to it’s last question:

*“What advice would you give aspiring engineers, aspiring students, aspiring scientists who want to contribute something to the defence sector?”*

> **“All students or anybody, including me, should first remain student all the life. You're getting a degree; you're getting a license to learn.”**

Great words, right? After all, if we let the desire to learn fade away, then we are never going to improve in life. Life is all about learning; learning happens at all phases in life, during, before, and after school, college, and even when we are pursuing our careers. Learning is key.

Moving on:

> *“Electrical Electronics department has a worldwide body called IEEE, where we have a concept called LLL - Lifelong Learning. So every student, if you want to contribute to the long run, for example, (has to learn) what I learned in 77, 79 in MTech computer science, computer engineering. Okay? So, the basics are still there, but I have to do much more study every day to remain in my job. And to lead my job, I need much more. So lifelong learning is one thing. And you will consider your degree as a license to learn more. Right? And, you know, there's a famous saying, "even when you're a student, let your schooling not interfere with your education." Okay? So what you start in your classes is one thing, but what you want to get educated in is what you learn.”*
