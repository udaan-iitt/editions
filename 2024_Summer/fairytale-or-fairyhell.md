<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Saw her holding the gathering,</br>
With nurturing vocals and feet snapping to the music,</br>
Smiling with her little eyes - she was mesmerizing,</br>
Neglecting where I was, illogic,</br>
Then my eyes went on searching,</br>
Finally, let the eyes speak.</br>
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Time flies to a chanceless void,</br>
Diminishing my mermaid memories,</br>
Ray thundered as often union-made,</br>
Stuck in warbling melodies,</br>
Dare enough to approach the mate,</br>
Best to take that astonishing smile.</br>
</p>



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Never seen the same again,</br>
Crushed every time expecting the same,</br>
Surreal illusion was pain,</br>
Letting the chance down was lame,</br>
Staying in hope will go in vain,</br>
Noticed the constant ignorance.</br>
</p>



<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Staying away may be a sin,</br>
Feelings for her never alter,</br>
Never got to know the other side,</br>
Better than taking the bitter,</br>
Realizing that pureness is secure,</br>
Embracing the angel fly high from far.</br>
