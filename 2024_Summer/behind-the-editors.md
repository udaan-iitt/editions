Behold! - Here comes the new academic year, and the new cycle. As bittersweet as it is to see our lovely senior-editors leave, there is no time for mourning - for the fresh batch of editors is already here! Let's begin:

### Pranathi

A short tiny girl from the department of computer sciences.....a small description about myself
before we start.....Hey there! This is Pranathi, one of the editors here in udaan. I really love to
speak, and blabber whatever that comes into my mind, which is the biggest flex in the era of
introverts. I also used to host events in my school days. With the same interest to speak, I
became a part of udaan last year. I hosted the 3rd podcast of udaan,The College Diaries and
really loved doing that. Back then,I was not much into writing...I know that even now I am not
doing it much. Apart from magazine works,I am very much interested in social welfare activities .
I also dance whenever possible, that might be on the stage of a well organized event or a
random beat out there. While most people these days state their hobby as photography, I would
state mine as getting photographs clicked. But being a lethargic girl, my most favorite hobby
would obviously be scrolling down my instagram reels.
“Being an average south Indian regular intermediate student I was only concentrating on the jee
for the two really..... really long years. So tiring. But time has changed now. Getting into a world
full of options and opportunities here is something different. Explore......the only thing that
always comes into my mind. Try something new,at the end of the day you are not gonna lose
something. Sometimes it feels like I am not fit for this perfectly mechanized world, it feels like
go... explore new things..find and stop at a place where you actually belong to. Restricted by
the boundaries of being a girl, I had always imagined being independent and self reliant. With
time comes the change, I hope. Now,here I am, ignoring all those who said she can't be there or
she can't do that or she shouldn't.... coming out of those ideologies , showing all those ‘can’t
and shouldn’t’ are actually possible and stepping into a new world.”-- with all these things in my
mind I entered this college and now happy that I had found something in which I am really
interested. For all those who think that a magazine is only about articles and literature,here I
am, the one who doesn’t write much but is still a part of udaan.
And......that’s it...looking forward to make many more podcasts and interesting stuff ahead
...and hope the audience would bear up with me.

We hope that the graduating seniors had a wonderful time in being a part of this team. And, we truly wish them the very best for whatever they are doing, wherever they are going, and whenever they may be "being, thinking, existing".
