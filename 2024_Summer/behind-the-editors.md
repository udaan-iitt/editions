Behold! - Here comes the new academic year, and the new cycle. As bittersweet as it is to see our lovely senior-editors leave, there is no time for mourning - for the fresh batch of editors is already here! Let's begin:

### Pranathi

A short tiny girl from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering... A small description about myself
before we start... Hey there! This is Pranathi, one of the editors here in Udaan.

I really love to speak, and blabber, whatever thing that comes into my mind (which is the biggest flex in this era of
introverts). Naturally, I also used to host events in my school days. With this same interest to speak, I became a part of Udaan last year. I hosted the 3<sup>rd</sup> podcast of Udaan - *The College Diaries*, and really loved doing that. Back then, I was not much into writing. I know that even now, I am not doing it (really as) much.

Apart from magazine works, I am very much interested in social welfare activities. I also dance whenever possible, whether that be on the stage of a well organized event or on a random beat out there. While most people, these days, state their hobby as photography, I would state mine as "getting photographs clicked". But being a lethargic girl, my most favourite hobby would obviously be scrolling down my Instagram reels.


Being an average south Indian regular intermediate student - I was only concentrating on the JEE
for the two really... really long years. So tiring. But time has changed now. Getting into a world
full of options and opportunities here is something different. To explore, is the only thing that
always comes into my mind. Try something new, at the end of the day, you are not gonna lose
something.

Sometimes it feels as if I am not fit for this perfectly mechanised world - it feels like as if I should go... explore new things... find and stop at a place where I actually belong to. Restricted by the boundaries of being a girl, I had always imagined being independent and self reliant. With time comes change, I hope.

Now, here I am, ignoring all those who said: "*She can't be there*" or "*She can't do that*" or "*She shouldn't...*" and so on. Coming out of those ideologies, showing that all those ‘*can’t and shouldn’t*’ are actually possible, and stepping into the new world - with all these things in my mind I entered this college and am now happy that I have found something in which I am really interested. For all those who think that a magazine is only about articles and literature, here I am, the one who doesn’t write much but is still a part of Udaan.


And... that’s it. Looking forward to make many more podcasts and interesting stuff ahead - I hope the audience would bear up with me.

### Aadhya

Hello, I am Aadhya, a self-proclaimed collection of paradoxes. Here is a tiny excerpt showcasing one of them (based on my experiences and the opinions of my two friends). How do the cold and rain make you feel? Sticky, annoying, gloomy, 'just get it over with' - oh, stop already? I'll take the bait here and say that they make me feel incredibly warm and happy.


It has been extremely hot lately, and I long for the rain now. Physically, I am enduring 47-degree weather, but my thoughts dwell in memories of rain and overcast skies. I find great joy in these 'gloomy' days, relishing every drop of rain.


For context, I was jumping mid-end sems in December because of the heavy showers and my perfectly curated sad lover playlist. This might sound sadistic, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cyclone. Let me explain: firstly, it was my first time experiencing cyclonic weather, and I wasn't in perilous proximity to it. So, it was basically 1.5 weeks of
constant rain - and who could be disappointed with that (except my clothes because they stank)? Secondly, it was December, and it was somewhat cold - quite contrary to the usual Tirupati weather, so my Delhi heart was happy.


I have often been questioned over my enthusiasm for the so-called depressing rainy season, but I find it deeply elating. The rhythmic patter of rain, the constant evening skies, the smell of wet mud, and the fresh breeze are unparalleled. Visualise the sudden eruption of green, clean dusky skies, drenched trees, deep grey concrete, colourful umbrellas, puddles, gliding motors, and the comfort of chai.


You might argue about the lack of vitamin D my body receives, but even a pill could give me the required dosage. However, no drug could satiate the comfort that these visuals provide.


Allow me to become slightly philosophical for a moment:

>
> “In a glistening world, with solitude booming, the child asks the rain about the consolation he receives from the sunless, shadowy skies.
>
> To this, the gentle rain replies: "It is because it all leads to where the light lies."”


To end, the rain for me brings the comfort of familiarity and constancy. It associates itself with each year of my life, and nostalgia, my friend, is warm. In the rain I find a little piece of home no matter where I am.

Yes, there are modern issues: flooding in cities, potholes overflowing, the traffic and chaos, the insects, and the following humidity. But hey, I am going to use my writer's privileges here and choose blissful ignorance over these inconveniences.

We hope that the graduating seniors had a wonderful time in being a part of this team. And, we truly wish them the very best for whatever they are doing, wherever they are going, and whenever they may be "being, thinking, existing".
