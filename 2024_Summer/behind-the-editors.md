Behold! - Here comes the new academic year, and the new cycle. As bittersweet as it is to see our lovely senior-editors leave, there is no time for mourning - for the fresh batch of editors is already here! Let's begin:

### Aadhya

Hello, I am Aadhya, a self-proclaimed collection of paradoxes. Here is a tiny excerpt showcasing one of them (based on my experiences and the opinions of my two friends). How do the cold and rain make you feel? Sticky, annoying, gloomy, 'just get it over with' - oh, stop already? I'll take the bait here and say that they make me feel incredibly warm and happy.

It has been extremely hot lately, and I long for the rain now. Physically, I am enduring 47-degree weather, but my thoughts dwell in memories of rain and overcast skies. I find great joy in these 'gloomy' days, relishing every drop of rain.

For context, I was jumping mid-end sems in December because of the heavy showers and my perfectly curated sad lover playlist. This might sound sadistic, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cyclone. Let me explain: firstly, it was my first time experiencing cyclonic weather, and I wasn't in perilous proximity to it. So, it was basically 1.5 weeks of
constant rain - and who could be disappointed with that (except my clothes because they stank)? Secondly, it was December, and it was somewhat cold - quite contrary to the usual Tirupati weather, so my Delhi heart was happy.

I have often been questioned over my enthusiasm for the so-called depressing rainy season, but I find it deeply elating. The rhythmic patter of rain, the constant evening skies, the smell of wet mud, and the fresh breeze are unparalleled. Visualise the sudden eruption of green, clean dusky skies, drenched trees, deep grey concrete, colourful umbrellas, puddles, gliding motors, and the comfort of chai.

You might argue about the lack of vitamin D my body receives, but even a pill could give me the required dosage. However, no drug could satiate the comfort that these visuals provide.

Allow me to become slightly philosophical for a moment:

> *“In a glistening world, with solitude booming, the child asks the rain about the consolation he receives from the sunless, shadowy skies.*
>
> *To this, the gentle rain replies: "It is because it all leads to where the light lies."”*

To end, the rain for me brings the comfort of familiarity and constancy. It associates itself with each year of my life, and nostalgia, my friend, is warm. In the rain I find a little piece of home no matter where I am.

Yes, there are modern issues: flooding in cities, potholes overflowing, the traffic and chaos, the insects, and the following humidity. But hey, I am going to use my writer's privileges here and choose blissful ignorance over these inconveniences.

### Adithya

When I was first asked, “List out some topics which really interest you”, a couple of my replies were instant but my head felt a bit empty. In the seconds that followed, a train of various topics ran through my mind, ranging from my favourite fiction series to the sport I follow the most. Before we enter my mind, let’s get to know the person. This is Adithya (yes, there’s an ‘h’ in there), and one thing I can’t do is find a ‘single’ word to describe me - unless there is a term for a bibliophile, cricket super fan, tech enthusiast, someone who loves public speaking (the list goes on so we’ll stop for now), all rolled into one person. Inside my head, I’m Elon Musk 2.0. On the outside, everyone probably has different perspectives on me. So let us stick to three simple topics: Cricket, Harry Potter and me!

What I still find amazing is that until 2017, I hated cricket and it wasn’t until 2018 when I realised that the sport I used to hate the most had managed to introduce me to a brand new world. I came to understand that there was so much more to cricket than just hitting a ball with a wooden stick. Bowling wasn’t running in, grunting and throwing a ball with all your might. Batting wasn’t blindly slogging at every ball. There existed terms such as ‘shot selection’, ‘seam’, ‘swing’, ‘matchups’, and even ‘mankading’ (my favourite controversy). Half of my Youtube recommendations were (and they still are) filled with videos on interviews, press conferences and even amazing playlists on cricket history. Whether it was the unstoppable Windies team of the 70s, the invincible Aussie bandwagon of the 2000s, India’s remarkable 1983 World Cup win, or the tragic 1999 Semi Final, our sport is full of amazing moments that are forever etched in history.

Learning about the journeys of various cricketers can give a lot of insight into their mentality and provides a lot of teachings. Whether it’s Kohli’s mentality, Tendulkar’s dedication, Ponting’s competitiveness, or Dhoni’s calm attitude - one can find a bunch of life-influencing qualities hidden behind their performances.

An aspect of the game that I’ve really come to enjoy is commentary, which I find to be really underrated. As a viewer, a game without commentary is like biryani without any spice (too bland and feels weird). It is the ability of a commentator to not just narrate what’s happening on the field, but also keep the audience engaged and hooked to the action. One man who has revolutionised this art would undoubtedly be Mr. Harsha Bhogle whose wit and eloquence have garnered many admirers, including me.

Even today, I can’t imagine getting through lunch without visiting the Cricinfo website at least once. Catching the latest score, reading about stats and matchups has become a constant. And if there’s nothing going on, I manage to catch up on poignant articles about the various aspects of the game that so often go unnoticed by the average viewer. I guess the influence those write ups had on me have inspired me to join Udaan, searching for opportunities to write a bit more.

Phew, let’s take a break from the real world for a while. The creativity of the human mind (and thank god for JK Rowling’s) has been a gift to mankind. I can’t think of a better example of this quality than Harry Potter. I spent many years hearing about the famous ‘name’ but continued to ignore the series until I ran out of stuff to read. I picked up book 1, then 2, and then 3. It was around book 2 where I fell in love with the series and finishing it became a kind of personal mission. It may be a series about wizards, but the magic was in the story. The characters, the quirky names, the way spells were named, the intriguing plot twists, the character arcs, all of it was so well-crafted. I guess the reason we are so enamoured with such stories is not just because of the characters themselves, but also because of the universe they exist in. I guess the most beautiful thing about sharing interests with many people is that you have a whole crowd to talk to. It’s about listening to the unique perspectives that people have to offer. It’s having those late night chats or discussions with your favourite people about the things that fascinate you. You discuss fan theories, plot holes, future events, possible changes which could’ve been made. Connecting with people online has never been easier.

Honestly, being an introvert never means that you have nothing to say. Rather, it feels like your mind is an explosion of ideas and thoughts running past each other. But it’s talking about these random thoughts with those whom you connect with that feels like bliss. The thing I’ve always found weird is that I'm probably not the best person to keep a conversation going on for a really long time - but give me a stage and a mic and I’m a dictator giving energetic speeches about any topic under the Sun ;).  I’ve heard (so-called) rumours that the words 'introvert’ and ‘public speaking’ don’t go well together - but it’s always great to be an outlier. Hmmm... this is probably why I love cricket commentary as well. (Someone get me a mike, quick) Also, if you’ve been this patient to come this far, kudos to you mate and we can definitely catch up for a chat about anything ;). Till then, permit me to leave you with this:

### Anvay

<!--StartFragment-->

Hello world! Anvay this side! I love to do an assortment of things, but most importantly I love to talk about the things I love. So, here is a little something about me that you might enjoy reading, have fun ;).

As a young child, I grew up very curious. Every day I kept asking questions: “*Why does the horse have four legs?*”, “*Can a hen fly like a crow does?*”, “*Where does the rainbow originate from*?”, “*How were colours discovered?*” and so on. As I grew older, I got the answers to a few questions, and became wise (or should I say negligent) enough to ignore the rest. I am a person who loves to sit and ponder to myself, I love to sail the river of thought. I have developed a lot of hobbies on the way, but something I never  mentioned before is my habit of getting lost in thought. I feel like the mind is the most beautiful thing in the whole universe, I love to get lost in the chain of thoughts, for my mind efficiently creates scenarios, made-up conversations and conjures people at my freewill. I love to sit and visit the little imaginary world of my own, taking refuge from reality for a while.

Sometimes, I am so lost that reality feels like an illusion - this sometimes gets me frightened, I am weird that way. I think about literally anything, but the most interesting thought process I have is when I try to trace the origin of stuff, and actually come to a conclusion. By stuff here, I mean anything from the names of the shops on the road that have been running since the early 20th century to how a particular car has been designed or why a tree has grown the way it has grown. Mostly, I hit a dead end at some point of time - but sometimes, I am able to reason out why things are the way things are, and then I am met with utmost joy.

Many people have told me that I am blanked out sometimes, but I like it that way :). What is sad is that I have a plethora of different hobbies - reading, poetry, listening to music, playing badminton and table tennis, watching stand-up comedy, and the list goes on… This leaves me with no or very less time to sit back and visit the world of my imagination. Though I will say that this strange habit of thinking and asking questions helps me to write poems effortlessly most of the time, something I consider as a gift from the universe.

Poetry has always baffled me, and I had never imagined I would ever write anything near a poem myself. After all, poetry is all about letting your subconscious take over and fill your canvas in the most classic style of literature ever. Oh! And lastly, I love talking to people - listening to their opinions about something and then presenting mine to them leading to a healthy exchange is something I would never want to miss out on. So, if you ever feel like having a go to guy to have deep conversations with or even do a poetry collab, that would be me ;).

### Pranathi

A short tiny girl from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering... A small description about myself
before we start... Hey there! This is Pranathi, one of the editors here in Udaan.

I really love to speak, and blabber, whatever thing that comes into my mind (which is the biggest flex in this era of
introverts). Naturally, I also used to host events in my school days. With this same interest to speak, I became a part of Udaan last year. I hosted the 3<sup>rd</sup> podcast of Udaan - *The College Diaries*, and really loved doing that. Back then, I was not much into writing. I know that even now, I am not doing it (really as) much.

Apart from magazine works, I am very much interested in social welfare activities. I also dance whenever possible, whether that be on the stage of a well organized event or on a random beat out there. While most people, these days, state their hobby as photography, I would state mine as "getting photographs clicked". But being a lethargic girl, my most favourite hobby would obviously be scrolling down my Instagram reels.

Being an average south Indian regular intermediate student - I was only concentrating on the JEE
for the two really... really long years. So tiring. But time has changed now. Getting into a world
full of options and opportunities here is something different. To explore, is the only thing that
always comes into my mind. Try something new, at the end of the day, you are not gonna lose
something.

Sometimes it feels as if I am not fit for this perfectly mechanised world - it feels like as if I should go... explore new things... find and stop at a place where I actually belong to. Restricted by the boundaries of being a girl, I had always imagined being independent and self reliant. With time comes change, I hope.

Now, here I am, ignoring all those who said: "*She can't be there*" or "*She can't do that*" or "*She shouldn't...*" and so on. Coming out of those ideologies, showing that all those ‘*can’t and shouldn’t*’ are actually possible, and stepping into the new world - with all these things in my mind I entered this college and am now happy that I have found something in which I am really interested. For all those who think that a magazine is only about articles and literature, here I am, the one who doesn’t write much but is still a part of Udaan.

And... that’s it. Looking forward to make many more podcasts and interesting stuff ahead - I hope the audience would bear up with me.

<br>

We hope that the graduating seniors had a wonderful time in being a part of this team. And, we truly wish them the very best for whatever they are doing, wherever they are going, and whenever they may be "being, thinking, existing".
