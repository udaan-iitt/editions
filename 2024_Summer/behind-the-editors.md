### Ritvik

Greetings, fellow literary aficionados!


Allow me to introduce myself: I’m Ritvik Ravi, the club’s resident dreamer, grammar vigilante, and self-appointed guardian of proper punctuation. Let me take you on a journey through my whimsical world, where literature makes up a big part, and deadlines are mere suggestions. I’d like to compare my life to a Dickens novel, except with fewer orphans and more existential crises about which book to read next.


Literature has always played a huge role in my life growing up. My journey into the literary world began at a tender age when I discovered that books were the perfect escape from reality – not that reality was unpleasant, but books had dragons and time travel. While the other kids were playing video games, I was making up epic battles between Jason Grace, Aslan, and Harry Potter. I still firmly believe that my Hogwarts letter is still lost somewhere in the mail.


My reading habits can be best explained as chaotic. I have a habit of reading up on all the books we buy in the summer within a week and left yearning for more. I wouldn’t brag much, but my bookshelf is a testament to my eclectic taste- ranging from the ‘I Funny’ series by James Patterson to the mythological tales of Rick Riordan, the fantasy world of J.R.R Tolkien, scientific books by Hawking and Michio Kaku to the yearly editions of the Manorama.


While my love for the written word is strong, I also love playing and watching hand-based sports like tennis, badminton, or even cricket (I suck at football). My love for music is beyond the literary limitations of the word ‘love’. Listening to The Weeknd, Drake, Kanye, and Lana Del Ray is a huge part of my growing up. On a side note, if you can’t find anyone to debate on the rap beef that happened with Drake and Kendrick, I’ll be happy enough to indulge in an enlightening conversation.


Finally, I love learning anything sci-tech. This might be the most generic statement ever (like, who hasn’t said that?), but I mean it in the truer sense. Talk to me anywhere from tissue culture to Artificial Intelligence and all the way to the Voyager series of probes- and I could go on rambling for at least half an hour while mostly maintaining factual accuracy.


To conclude, joining Udaan was a no-brainer. Here, I’ve found kindred spirits who understand the love to write poems and articles about their passionate topics, and also the agony of finishing a beloved series. Plus, there’s always the hope that someone will finally explain to me what War and Peace is all about. I’m excited to embark on this literary adventure with all of you. Let’s read, write, and procrastinate together – and maybe, just maybe, we’ll create something worth putting down our mugs of coffee for.

Yours in bibliomania,<br>
Ritvik Ravi

### Aadhya

Hello, I am Aadhya, a self-proclaimed collection of paradoxes. Here is a tiny excerpt showcasing one of them (based on my experiences and the opinions of my two friends). How do the cold and rain make you feel? Sticky, annoying, gloomy, 'just get it over with' - oh, stop already? I'll take the bait here and say that they make me feel incredibly warm and happy.

It has been extremely hot lately, and I long for the rain now. Physically, I am enduring 47-degree weather, but my thoughts dwell in memories of rain and overcast skies. I find great joy in these 'gloomy' days, relishing every drop of rain.

For context, I was jumping mid-end sems in December because of the heavy showers and my perfectly curated sad lover playlist. This might sound sadistic, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cyclone. Let me explain: firstly, it was my first time experiencing cyclonic weather, and I wasn't in perilous proximity to it. So, it was basically 1.5 weeks of
constant rain - and who could be disappointed with that (except my clothes because they stank)? Secondly, it was December, and it was somewhat cold - quite contrary to the usual Tirupati weather, so my Delhi heart was happy.

I have often been questioned over my enthusiasm for the so-called depressing rainy season, but I find it deeply elating. The rhythmic patter of rain, the constant evening skies, the smell of wet mud, and the fresh breeze are unparalleled. Visualise the sudden eruption of green, clean dusky skies, drenched trees, deep grey concrete, colourful umbrellas, puddles, gliding motors, and the comfort of chai.

You might argue about the lack of vitamin D my body receives, but even a pill could give me the required dosage. However, no drug could satiate the comfort that these visuals provide.

Allow me to become slightly philosophical for a moment:

> *“In a glistening world, with solitude booming, the child asks the rain about the consolation he receives from the sunless, shadowy skies.*
>
> *To this, the gentle rain replies: "It is because it all leads to where the light lies."”*

To end, the rain for me brings the comfort of familiarity and constancy. It associates itself with each year of my life, and nostalgia, my friend, is warm. In the rain I find a little piece of home no matter where I am.

Yes, there are modern issues: flooding in cities, potholes overflowing, the traffic and chaos, the insects, and the following humidity. But hey, I am going to use my writer's privileges here and choose blissful ignorance over these inconveniences.

### Adithya

When I was first asked, “List out some topics which really interest you”, a couple of my replies were instant but my head felt a bit empty. In the seconds that followed, a train of various topics ran through my mind, ranging from my favourite fiction series to the sport I follow the most. Before we enter my mind, let’s get to know the person. This is Adithya (yes, there’s an ‘h’ in there), and one thing I can’t do is find a ‘single’ word to describe me - unless there is a term for a bibliophile, cricket super fan, tech enthusiast, someone who loves public speaking (the list goes on so we’ll stop for now), all rolled into one person. Inside my head, I’m Elon Musk 2.0. On the outside, everyone probably has different perspectives on me. So let us stick to three simple topics: Cricket, Harry Potter and me!

What I still find amazing is that until 2017, I hated cricket and it wasn’t until 2018 when I realised that the sport I used to hate the most had managed to introduce me to a brand new world. I came to understand that there was so much more to cricket than just hitting a ball with a wooden stick. Bowling wasn’t running in, grunting and throwing a ball with all your might. Batting wasn’t blindly slogging at every ball. There existed terms such as ‘shot selection’, ‘seam’, ‘swing’, ‘matchups’, and even ‘mankading’ (my favourite controversy). Half of my Youtube recommendations were (and they still are) filled with videos on interviews, press conferences and even amazing playlists on cricket history. Whether it was the unstoppable Windies team of the 70s, the invincible Aussie bandwagon of the 2000s, India’s remarkable 1983 World Cup win, or the tragic 1999 Semi Final, our sport is full of amazing moments that are forever etched in history.

Learning about the journeys of various cricketers can give a lot of insight into their mentality and provides a lot of teachings. Whether it’s Kohli’s mentality, Tendulkar’s dedication, Ponting’s competitiveness, or Dhoni’s calm attitude - one can find a bunch of life-influencing qualities hidden behind their performances.

An aspect of the game that I’ve really come to enjoy is commentary, which I find to be really underrated. As a viewer, a game without commentary is like biryani without any spice (too bland and feels weird). It is the ability of a commentator to not just narrate what’s happening on the field, but also keep the audience engaged and hooked to the action. One man who has revolutionised this art would undoubtedly be Mr. Harsha Bhogle whose wit and eloquence have garnered many admirers, including me.

Even today, I can’t imagine getting through lunch without visiting the Cricinfo website at least once. Catching the latest score, reading about stats and matchups has become a constant. And if there’s nothing going on, I manage to catch up on poignant articles about the various aspects of the game that so often go unnoticed by the average viewer. I guess the influence those write ups had on me have inspired me to join Udaan, searching for opportunities to write a bit more.

Phew, let’s take a break from the real world for a while. The creativity of the human mind (and thank god for JK Rowling’s) has been a gift to mankind. I can’t think of a better example of this quality than Harry Potter. I spent many years hearing about the famous ‘name’ but continued to ignore the series until I ran out of stuff to read. I picked up book 1, then 2, and then 3. It was around book 2 where I fell in love with the series and finishing it became a kind of personal mission. It may be a series about wizards, but the magic was in the story. The characters, the quirky names, the way spells were named, the intriguing plot twists, the character arcs, all of it was so well-crafted. I guess the reason we are so enamoured with such stories is not just because of the characters themselves, but also because of the universe they exist in. I guess the most beautiful thing about sharing interests with many people is that you have a whole crowd to talk to. It’s about listening to the unique perspectives that people have to offer. It’s having those late night chats or discussions with your favourite people about the things that fascinate you. You discuss fan theories, plot holes, future events, possible changes which could’ve been made. Connecting with people online has never been easier.

Honestly, being an introvert never means that you have nothing to say. Rather, it feels like your mind is an explosion of ideas and thoughts running past each other. But it’s talking about these random thoughts with those whom you connect with that feels like bliss. The thing I’ve always found weird is that I'm probably not the best person to keep a conversation going on for a really long time - but give me a stage and a mic and I’m a dictator giving energetic speeches about any topic under the Sun ;).  I’ve heard (so-called) rumours that the words 'introvert’ and ‘public speaking’ don’t go well together - but it’s always great to be an outlier. Hmmm... this is probably why I love cricket commentary as well. (Someone get me a mike, quick) Also, if you’ve been this patient to come this far, kudos to you mate and we can definitely catch up for a chat about anything ;). Till then, permit me to leave you with this:

### Anvay

<!--StartFragment-->

Hello world! Anvay this side! I love to do an assortment of things, but most importantly I love to talk about the things I love. So, here is a little something about me that you might enjoy reading, have fun ;).

As a young child, I grew up very curious. Every day I kept asking questions: “*Why does the horse have four legs?*”, “*Can a hen fly like a crow does?*”, “*Where does the rainbow originate from*?”, “*How were colours discovered?*” and so on. As I grew older, I got the answers to a few questions, and became wise (or should I say negligent) enough to ignore the rest. I am a person who loves to sit and ponder to myself, I love to sail the river of thought. I have developed a lot of hobbies on the way, but something I never  mentioned before is my habit of getting lost in thought. I feel like the mind is the most beautiful thing in the whole universe, I love to get lost in the chain of thoughts, for my mind efficiently creates scenarios, made-up conversations and conjures people at my freewill. I love to sit and visit the little imaginary world of my own, taking refuge from reality for a while.

Sometimes, I am so lost that reality feels like an illusion - this sometimes gets me frightened, I am weird that way. I think about literally anything, but the most interesting thought process I have is when I try to trace the origin of stuff, and actually come to a conclusion. By stuff here, I mean anything from the names of the shops on the road that have been running since the early 20th century to how a particular car has been designed or why a tree has grown the way it has grown. Mostly, I hit a dead end at some point of time - but sometimes, I am able to reason out why things are the way things are, and then I am met with utmost joy.

Many people have told me that I am blanked out sometimes, but I like it that way :). What is sad is that I have a plethora of different hobbies - reading, poetry, listening to music, playing badminton and table tennis, watching stand-up comedy, and the list goes on… This leaves me with no or very less time to sit back and visit the world of my imagination. Though I will say that this strange habit of thinking and asking questions helps me to write poems effortlessly most of the time, something I consider as a gift from the universe.

Poetry has always baffled me, and I had never imagined I would ever write anything near a poem myself. After all, poetry is all about letting your subconscious take over and fill your canvas in the most classic style of literature ever. Oh! And lastly, I love talking to people - listening to their opinions about something and then presenting mine to them leading to a healthy exchange is something I would never want to miss out on. So, if you ever feel like having a go to guy to have deep conversations with or even do a poetry collab, that would be me ;).

### Dharmesh

Hmm… about my life, eh? I’m probably like that one dude who wants to do everything but does nothing (unless something is at stake). There are probably *some* random interesting stuffs (some might not be interesting to you) in my life. Let me take you through the latest one - Football.


Before coming to this campus, I wasn’t much of a football fan. I just used to play football for some time during P.E. class. I mostly used to play volleyball and was selected in my school’s volleyball squad. When I went to volleyball selection here, I realized, like many people, I had lost touch with my skills due to COVID and JEE preparation. My friends used to play football regularly, and that’s when my football journey truly kicked off. While playing, I realized my instincts were good, and I predict well, so I started playing as a goalkeeper. All the non-football fans are probably like, “Oh, goalkeeper, very easy, right? That too, as you used to volleyball before, it will be very similar and you just have to catch the ball, right?” YEAH BRO! Really easy. (Cue in the *"smile in pain"* sticker.)

This reminds me of Madrid vs Bayern 2nd leg. Neuer was an absolute GOAT (bro literally was the best goalkeeper I had seen) till the 87th minute, but he just made 1 mistake, and all the excellent saves were erased from the viewers’ minds. That’s a goalkeeper for you. Even as a Madrid fan, I felt pain just seeing that. I understand how he would’ve felt. Now that I have mentioned it, I know Bayern fans will accuse us of stealing. But, bro, it's not our fault. I accept what happened was unfair, but it was Refree’s fault, not ours. If the whistle hadn’t been blown, maybe Lunin would’ve saved, or perhaps it would’ve been a goal we never know. (Even if you went to finals, you have Harry Kane, so Dortmund will w…) I think I went a little overboard; let’s come back.

Even though I played football almost every day in the 1st sem, I didn’t really start watching football. When I realized I was very weak in the Sports Quiz (wait, even the other ones… ermm let’s move on), I wanted to follow some sports; that’s when watching football started. So when Kridan was held the last sem, I got selected. I felt happy, excited, and nervous. The 1st match went pretty well until the opponent got a penalty. It was goalless until then, to be honest, and I was pretty nervous. It’s your first match, and there are barely 10-15 minutes left in the game; you definitely have to save it. The penalty taker shoots... Guess what? I saved, it bounced from my hand, and I punched it. It was and will be one of the best moments in my football journey. Even while writing this, I feel happy thinking about that time. It reminded me why I like being a goalie. The striker's face when you save the shot is worth a goalie's pain (It’s like as if I almost get a dopamine rush from that). But wait a minute, we still lost the match. The opponent scored a top-corner banger in the last 5 mins :(.

 Even though we won the second match, we lost the third match. Even now, sometimes I think I should’ve saved the last goal in the third match. But the fact is, nothing can be done about it now. Just have to accept it, and practice so that it doesn’t repeat itself. After this, I started watching highlights of football matches. The 1st match that I fully watched was Madrid vs Bayern 1st leg. Brooooo, what was that Kroos pass? It was literally the best pass I’d ever seen. (I know I have very little ball knowledge; trying to learn, bro :)) (P.S. Even though I respect Reus, Madrid will win its 15th UCL title.)

### Pranathi

A short tiny girl from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering... A small description about myself
before we start... Hey there! This is Pranathi, one of the editors here in Udaan.

I really love to speak, and blabber, whatever thing that comes into my mind (which is the biggest flex in this era of
introverts). Naturally, I also used to host events in my school days. With this same interest to speak, I became a part of Udaan last year. I hosted the 3<sup>rd</sup> podcast of Udaan - *The College Diaries*, and really loved doing that. Back then, I was not much into writing. I know that even now, I am not doing it (really as) much.

Apart from magazine works, I am very much interested in social welfare activities. I also dance whenever possible, whether that be on the stage of a well organized event or on a random beat out there. While most people, these days, state their hobby as photography, I would state mine as "getting photographs clicked". But being a lethargic girl, my most favourite hobby would obviously be scrolling down my Instagram reels.

Being an average south Indian regular intermediate student - I was only concentrating on the JEE
for the two really... really long years. So tiring. But time has changed now. Getting into a world
full of options and opportunities here is something different. To explore, is the only thing that
always comes into my mind. Try something new, at the end of the day, you are not gonna lose
something.

Sometimes it feels as if I am not fit for this perfectly mechanised world - it feels like as if I should go... explore new things... find and stop at a place where I actually belong to. Restricted by the boundaries of being a girl, I had always imagined being independent and self reliant. With time comes change, I hope.

Now, here I am, ignoring all those who said: "*She can't be there*" or "*She can't do that*" or "*She shouldn't...*" and so on. Coming out of those ideologies, showing that all those ‘*can’t and shouldn’t*’ are actually possible, and stepping into the new world - with all these things in my mind I entered this college and am now happy that I have found something in which I am really interested. For all those who think that a magazine is only about articles and literature, here I am, the one who doesn’t write much but is still a part of Udaan.

And... that’s it. Looking forward to make many more podcasts and interesting stuff ahead - I hope the audience would bear up with me.

### Jonell

<p align="center"><u>My Roman Empire</u></p>

Young children always want to grow up, finish school and start to “adult”. Because to us this means that we don't need to study, don't have homework, don't have tight braids, and there are no restrictions on what we wear. We get to be independent, form our own thoughts and express them without being shushed or told to keep quiet because “the grown-ups are talking”. When we grow up, we become “the grown-ups”, we have the freedom to be creative and show it off on our own terms. 

As a child, my mum would tell me a lot and I mean A LOT of stories. Most of us and I grew up believing in talking animals, potions, fairy dust and wonderland. I still do believe in fairy dust, it just has taken on a whole new meaning. These stories feed into our innocent need to be creative, it would always lead to boundless imagination and dozens of side quests that I would make up in my mind just to entertain myself because my strict parents never let me watch T.V. or scroll through a phone. They built a world for me with their words, and I continued decorating and beautifying it in my mind. I had secret gardens and magic pink shoes and a gateway under my bed that led me to a fountain with sweet, sparkling water with healing properties. It had cottages and forests and castles and carriages that could talk, it was a whole new world in a land far, far away.

You sit in your classroom while your poor chemistry teacher is trying to get your classroom of 37 to memorise the first 20 elements of the periodic table, but throughout it, you are lost in a world of dancing princesses and diamond castles. While sitting and daydreaming, you hear someone talk about a place called Peshawar, you never heard this name before, it sounds very different, so unique that you do not even know how to pronounce it. “Oh my goodness, new map unlocked, let us check it out”. You go home and look it up. Bad idea, Jo, terrible idea. You wonder why there are videos and nightmare-inducing pictures of people just a couple of years older to you and younger than you and even people your age lying motionless, covered in a brownish-red sorta substance. This is when what the grown-ups call “the real world” hits you. 

You go back to school the next day, daydreaming as you always do (the grown-ups call it “dissociating”), but this time your mind doesn't run to Fairytopia, it goes to a place, not more than halfway across the world and you imagine yourself in those torn, empty shoes you saw on the internet yesterday and start to think about how you could have saved that world from the tragedy it suffered. You know that the scenario you’re thinking of is not real, none of the scenarios you ever thought of were real and you were always aware of it, but for the first time, the fact that you are helpless disturbs you in a way you never felt before. You then begin to wonder why your mind would take you to a place that unsettles you rather than a place that comforts you (like it always used to do). This confuses you and even slightly scares you. So, in a desperate attempt to save the world of magic and pastries in your mind, you start to pen down everything you remember, you put it all down on paper in any way you can. You don't have properly built storylines or characters with names and faces. They all exist in your mind, but you never really gave them identities, so this makes it harder to save. You can feel it all slowly fade away as you try to capture everything you love about that world. You can always go back to the stories and the movies from which this world you built stems, but will you ever be able to remember or capture everything that is slipping through your fingers right now? Will you be able to remember the details that are not very well defined in your mind but they exist and you know what it feels like but you cannot describe it? Will you be able to get it back if you rewatch and re-read and re-hear all those stories? With all these thoughts running through your mind, you try your best to capture everything you can. 

You are now left with terribly written paragraphs about the world you built because, despite your best efforts, your imagination is way wilder than what mere ink and paper will ever be able to capture. Now, you are scared that you will slowly forget your thoughts and lose the imaginary worlds that you love. So you begin to write down everything the moment the thought hits you because you cannot go through the loss of having a world crumble around you again. Your thoughts now start to take the forms of poems and letters (that you never send) and stories and conversations. The “wiser” you get and as your grey hairs grow in number, the inspiration from where your creativity stems, to you, seems to narrow down to your experiences. You no longer write about lands far, far away, but instead, focus on experiences that are near and dear to you. Is this happening because your imagination is limiting itself or because your experiences are expanding?

### Akshay

Hi, I’m Akshay. I spend half of my life rotting in my bedroom. I am very good at procrastination. I have been procrastinating on this article for a while, too. Someone who knows me would say I’m the kind of person who would find interacting with someone (who doesn’t share a single interest with me) difficult. That could be anyone if we are being fair, but some people tend to adapt to their surroundings. 

So, what are my interests? I love watching football. I may not be athletic enough to play it, but I love watching it. I am also interested in Formula 1, watching movies and series, and gaming with the homies. No, I don’t play Valorant and never will. Since two other people have already talked about football, I will not delve into it much. I support Manchester United, so if you support them too, hit me up :) (consider yourself an opp if you are ten hag out though).

I’m pretty new to playing video games and watching movies. I only started catching up with this genre of entertainment during lockdown. I sometimes wonder how I survived until then with no personality whatsoever. I like playing games that are more focused on the story while also challenging. My favourite games are *Persona 4 Golden* and *The Arkham Trilogy*. Lately, I have been playing a lot of *Deep Rock Galactic* with my friends. It's a co-op game that you can buy on Steam. I find it fun when you can play a game with your friends without having to face random people and get toxic with each other, like in Valorant or CSGO, for example.

At this point, it feels like I’m giving an interview and an introduction so you can decide whether you want to be friends with me. *That’s how we do it here*.

I don’t like to think much about life and its consequences. My general belief is that people are not complex. It’s not too deep. Everyone has their circumstances, and they act accordingly. I like staying out of trouble and not arguing much with people, but sometimes, while being excited, I try to stir things up even though I might agree with them. Like, I would agree Bruno Fernandes had a bad game, but if I see someone hating on him, I will start trolling and say he’s had a good game just to piss them off.

I have also played *Dungeons and Dragons* with some guys once-a-week for the past six months. It might get boring sometimes, but the combat is really good. I learned that even the most boring things can be fun if the company is good.

It is tough to find a good company with whom you enjoy your time from the bottom of your heart; it's a hit-and-trial method. It works sometimes, but it also doesn’t. I had to meet and be friends with so many people before I found the right set. So, if you ever feel down and think you will never find good friends, don’t give up and keep trying.

### Neerav

<!--StartFragment-->

Life? It’s a rollercoaster of love, career, money, emotions – the list goes on, huh?

My grandfather used to say that you gotta live 50 years to learn to live the 51st year in the best way possible, because the only way to understand life is to live it- if you haven’t tried, you haven’t lived.

Oh well, I totally disagree with grandpa, because guess what - I am about to show you some dark magic that can get you to learn about life in just 90 minutes instead (maybe some added extra time, too)?!

Yep, baby, let me coin this magic act as football. Now, before all of you who don’t watch it skip the part, I just wanna let you know that I ain’t gonna bore anyone with any Mourinho, Klopp, Cristiano, or those fancy names.

Let’s try this dating exercise. Say you, A, met B. Now B watches football. Yes! A fell for B’s oceanic eyes, the charisma that pulled A’s eyeballs like a magnet towards B’s locomotion involuntarily. 

A starts developing feelings for B. But how does A know if B is worth the commitment?

How can A predict B’s personality? Well, you can, based on the football team B supports. It’s pretty simple - like you get the entire LinkedIn profile of the person’s mind without chatting or texting a single word by just judging the football club one supports. How? Here goes:

1. **Say B supports Manchester United (synonymous to RCB in cricket)**: A, go - these are fucking Amazon rainforests for god’s sake! Throw a bunch of saucy pickup lines; you won’t be disappointed in a million years. This team has been struggling for a decade since the departure of legends like Ronaldo, Rooney, Giggs, Keane, and their manager Sir Alex Ferguson. These fans are the 24-carat love ornaments you’ll get in today’s market. Patience (though they see no hope), resilience, and courage (overconfidence sometimes, but it’s SO CUTE to watch!) all ooze from their souls. These fans not only live in depression, but they have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Oh boy, if they don’t dare to stop supporting this team that has lost all its hype since 14 years ago, there is no way he’d give up on you randomly. This also holds if B supports Barcelona even after their legends left - patience is their blood group, and they are never gonna give you up (oh, you just got rickrolled)!\
   <br>
2. **Say B supports Real Madrid**: Now, this is a weird scenario. Do not trust this person quickly. This team is an institution that has seen the biggest of names and has seen the lowest of downfalls. In layman's terms, supporting Real Madrid is no big deal - I’d rank it the 2nd easiest thing to do in the world with the first being a Ryan Gosling fanboy (oh Ken o Ken, yes that's number 1). Either B has a fragile heart - it could shatter, thanks to the poor tensile strength or B could be a serial killer for success. Could we see the sacrifice of relationships here in pursuit of career success? I can’t say, sit back and observe. Only time will tell. This also applies to people who support clubs that have attained recent glory - Manchester City, PSG etc, to be precise - THIS IS WHERE THE MIND GAMES BEGIN!!\
   <br>
3. **Say B supports Bayern Munich**: This category of people can be categorized as self-focused, mildly egoistic, and success-oriented, but the strongest hearts you’ll find on your Tinder database. This team is known for their scary, powerful teams and balance. Unlike Real Madrid, this team functions on a business model that gives equal importance to financial management - the only football team with a net debt of 0 Euros. This hard worker goes to the big stages but falls out of luck - injuries or poor refereeing (the list goes on). Bayern fans have experienced the worst traumas and heartbreaks, albeit being the synonym for consistency, balance, perfection and hard luck. Date a Bayern fan, and these cutie-patooties (UwU) will always try their best to impress you no matter what, and they have seen the worst of the worst- you deserve a cuddle with the tremendous mental strength they possess (all free of cost because the author is a Bayern fan himself - DMs open - Phone number: 9145000435)\
   <br>
4. **Say B comes from a rare breed?**: Say B loves Arsenal. Or Chelsea. Or Juventus maybe. The rarer breed you’ll see in India, but again come in the list of dedicated lovers who haven’t seen happiness for quite some time. They’ll marry not only you, but your problems, stick to you like Fevi-kwik, and don’t give a shit about anyone’s opinions because it’s “Me, myself and I” for B.\
   <br>
5. **Say B supports nothing consistently?**: The deadliest group of people. Red flags, red carpets, call them whatever. They can be tossed into the category of plastic fanboys- supporting success and big names and changing names every week- Ronaldo, Messi, Madrid, whichever allows them to flex blindly. This category of people has no knowledge about anything- they simply fly with the clout.

So yep, this is why you should consider taking an interest in European football - not just improving your dating life, but also fostering life as a whole - teaching you about balance, miracles, planning, tactics, man management (I’ll take another essay to talk about this, but never mind), finance, respect, dealing with breakups, toxicity, and being more romantic - I’m none of the above. Still, you guys get the gist of it, I hope?
