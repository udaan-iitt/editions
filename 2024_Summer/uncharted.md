<p align="center">'Yes,' said Albert, faster we travelled<br>
Further as we went, surprises unravelled<br>
The pitch-black view made me paranoid<br>
Could we ever escape this treacherous void?<br>
</p>

<p align="center">'No,' said Albert, the fuel gauge said 'E'<br>
Maybe it was time for the final dragon spree<br>
In the corner lay a button, as green as emerald<br>
Could it take us back to our beautiful world?<br>
</p>

<p align="center">'Yes,' said Albert, down went the button<br>
For the first time ever, I felt like a glutton<br>
We burst forth, leaving a fiery trail behind<br>
Could the escape really be so hard to find?<br>
</p>

<p align="center">'No,' said Albert, we fell short<br>
Up came the message, "MISSION ABORT"<br>
Credits started rolling, itâ€™s always been the same<br>
Could I ever conquer this uncharted game?<br>
</p>
