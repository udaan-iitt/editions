abio: Aditya, hailing from Maharashtra and pursuing civil engineering at IIT
  Tirupati, is a vivid daydreamer and an all time night owl. Apart from binging
  movies, he loves to play cricket, attend quizzes, (try to) solve cryptic
  crosswords and hangout with friends. He also loves reading Myth fictions and
  sci-fi novels. Poetry is his doorway to escape reality and jump into his own
  little world, as perfect as his imagination.

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">'Yes,' said Albert, faster we travelled<br>
Further as we went, surprises unravelled<br>
The pitch-black view made me paranoid<br>
Could we ever escape this treacherous void?<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">'No,' said Albert, the fuel gauge said 'E'<br>
Maybe it was time for the final dragon spree<br>
In the corner lay a button, as green as emerald<br>
Could it take us back to our beautiful world?<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">'Yes,' said Albert, down went the button<br>
For the first time ever, I felt like a glutton<br>
We burst forth, leaving a fiery trail behind<br>
Could the escape really be so hard to find?<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">'No,' said Albert, we fell short<br>
Up came the message, "MISSION ABORT"<br>
Credits started rolling, itâ€™s always been the same<br>
Could I ever conquer this uncharted game?<br>
</p>
