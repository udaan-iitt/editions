'Yes,' said Albert, faster we travelled  
Further as we went, surprises unravelled  
The pitch-black view made me paranoid  
Could we ever escape this treacherous void?  

'No,' said Albert, the fuel gauge said 'E'  
Maybe it was time for the final dragon spree  
In the corner lay a button, as green as emerald  
Could it take us back to our beautiful world?  

'Yes,' said Albert, down went the button  
For the first time ever, I felt like a glutton  
We burst forth, leaving a fiery trail behind  
Could the escape really be so hard to find?  

'No,' said Albert, we fell short  
Up came the message, "MISSION ABORT"  
Credits started rolling, itâ€™s always been the same  
Could I ever conquer this uncharted game?
