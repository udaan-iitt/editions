<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Life is a journey that we try to explore<br>
With paths and destinations that we can't ignore<br>
But the more we travel, the less we arrive<br>
Where reality is a maze that we can't survive</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What do we seek and what do we find?<br>
Is it happiness or sorrow, pleasure or pain?<br>
Or is it wisdom or folly, knowledge or ignorance?<br>
Do we have a quest or a quest-ion, a mission or a miss-ion?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">I watched a couple walking, talking, and grinning,<br>
Thought I'd do the same, a good beginning,<br>
But with time, I learned, it's not all it seems,<br>
The crave of momentary desires, mere dreams.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">The things we seek to make us happy, <br>
Will fade away from our vision quickly, <br>
The pursuit, the hunt, all the stress and strain, <br>
Can leave a mess of thoughts in our brain.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">The pure joy in the Little Blue kid I see,<br>
Playing his flute and setting young calves free,<br>
The flowers bloom afresh when he's around,<br>
Rivers rise to touch his feet, a sacred ground.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">In his peacefulness, I find life's sweet essence,<br>
A world where love and peace find presence,<br>
In simplicity, we uncover what's meant to be,<br>
The secret is in being just with him, and feeling free!</p>
