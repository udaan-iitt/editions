title: A Second Chance
category: Poetry

desc: Wishing to change your past actions is a relatable thought, which this
  poem puts in the context of a dysfunctional family. But what’s done can't be
  changed and maybe, a change in perspective is your only solace in the
  aftermath.

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">What if I could do it all again? <br>
Would I live a little, lessen the pain?<br>
Where did it all go wrong?<br>
Did I worry too little, or worry for too long?</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Why did I cry alone?<br>
Why did I let them yell for reasons unknown?<br>
Why did I hide, why did I lie?<br>
How could I shut the door and not even try?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Why did I wish to not see them fight?<br>
Why did they scream day and night, while neither one was right?<br>
Why did I wish to never feel their pain?<br>
Why did I wish to never see them again?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Why did I get so mad?<br>
Why did I try to reason with my dad?<br>
Why did I wish to live in a fantasy?<br>
Why did I sleep and pray for another family?</p>


<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Why could they never be happy?<br>
Well now I know, their life was just that crappy,<br>
Why is loving so hard, why doesn't it always work?<br>
Why do you just have to try and not go berserk?<br>
So, what if I could do it all again?<br>
I’d wipe my tears, and hug their pain,<br>
Now I know where it all went wrong,<br>
They had to let it go, they’d been holding it for too long…</p>
