desc: "It takes a lot of hope, faith, and strength for a woman to wait for her
  husband to return safely from a war. Inspired by the legends, paying tribute
  to the pain of the families of warriors, join Iftekhar as he describes
  Penelope, wife of Odysseus, who spends her days weaving a piece of cloth and
  then unraveling it every night as she waits for her husband to return home
  from the Trojan War. "

abio: "If you ask a friend of Iftekar’s to describe him, the first word that
  will helplessly tumble out of their mouth is ‘poet’. The soft-spoken poet, who
  radiates positive vibes and wields excellent oratory skills, Iftekhar, is
  currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT
  Tirupati. He is also a well-known badminton player who spends his spare time
  immersed in books and movies. "

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Every day begins with the dawn,<br>
Sun rises at the eastern horizon,<br>
Her needles start moving forward,<br>
Weaving wools into a lovely piece,<br>
Along she stitches her wounds,<br>
Slowly healing her broken heart,<br>
Collecting each and every shard,<br>
Yet till dusk, one’s still lost,<br>
While she fights for heart,<br>
Leeching off her sweetheart’s fortune,<br>
Waiting for her faith to fall,<br>
She knows it’s incomplete clothe,<br>
Keeping those wolves at bay.<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">So when every dusk falls,<br>
Her needles start a reverse walk,<br>
Untangling the woven clothe,<br>
As needles open up every bond,<br>
Her wounds become raw again,<br>
All that she had ever dreaded,<br>
Every fear and every nightmare,<br>
All start to seem plausible,<br>
Yet she lights up her beacon,<br>
A beacon of hope and faith,<br>
Faith in her lost husband,<br>
And hope of him riding back,<br>
Riding on shimmering waves,<br>
And ending all her agonies.<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Every night she cuts her heart,<br>
Every day she heals her heart,<br>
While glimpsing at the faraway sea,<br>
The sea that took her other half.<br></p>
