desc: A man dives into a spiral of lucid dreams as he cannot discern between his

“*A starry night often may not accompany the light to see everything.*" Ammi used to say this a lot, I remember. I flip the rupee bills in my hand as I stare at a fat cop, sizing me up with his eyes. Why do I remember that all of a sudden? I keep wondering as I'm suddenly startled by a loud clap. 



"*You sure that 'chhokra' can do the job?*" he said as he pointed at Jamal sitting on a broken stool near the pale, cracked wall. 



Jamal stared at me with nervously adamant eyes as I answered, "*You don't worry about it, 'Sahib'. We will get the 'maal' for you."* 



The cop held out his pistol and shined it upon my eyes, "*I hope so*," and walked away as he chewed on his tobacco.



"*That man is not good*," said Jamal in a quivering, low voice.



"*Quiet*!"



The alleys of the slums were rarely safe for words, as they oozed out often to reach people who might cause trouble. As the clock ticked nine, I began walking down the alley with a bag full of rupee notes. It was dimly lit with brass lanterns, only lighting it up to barely make things visible around me. Indeed, a starry night sky enveloped us above, but these narrow lanes were always dark and full of unknowns.



"*What's that?*" Jamal pointed at a dark figure at some distance. I squinted my eyes, but then everything vanished, and my vision was now but a fluctuating train of glimpses. "*Shahid bhaiya, run!*" I could hear Jamal screaming. I opened my eyes, and I saw Jamal running behind me. Ahead of me was a six feet tall man with his face covered with a towel as he walked toward me. I looked at his hand, holding a knife as he started walking faster. 



Faster. 



He sprinted toward me with the blade and screamed. I froze. I couldn't move. I wish Jamal would help me. I wish he were here. Where did he go? The man had reached me, he was a meter away, yet he seemed miles away.



I could see him desperately sprinting as he screamed. I crouched halfway and gathered all my strength. I saw the knife in his hand approaching. Knife. Blood. I remembered that night; I remembered Ammi. She was there trying to ask for help, but no one came. I remembered her screams as the man tore her saree with a knife in his hand. I felt her screams echo through my body, and I felt the man touching her skin. I remembered the tears running down my cheeks as I shrieked. "*The world is cruel*," Ammi used to say, the same woman who was subjected to it in the most gruesome way. I looked in front of me, and I saw the man, with his head covered, reach me finally. He swung his knife at me, but it didn't cut through my skin. I felt the knife inside my flesh, but there was no blood. I held the blade, and it melted into water. I looked up, and the man was shorter now. I punched

him, and I unleashed the rage upon him that I felt toward the man who killed my mother. My 'Ammi'.



The man fell on the floor and looked up at me. Suddenly, I felt powerful. 



I felt tall. 



I pulled the man and unraveled the cloth on his head to take a look at his face. It's Jamal! How is it possible? I thought about the cop and the bag of money in my hand. Wait, where is the bag? It was suddenly daytime, and I saw myself sitting in a room with money all around. I thought I was dreaming: no, I was dreaming. I knew of this. Everything moved according to me, all the chess pieces. The world danced around like my own puppet show. I was the master of everything, but where was I? I saw a woman in a veil entering through one of the three doors in the room. She held a silver plate as she walked toward me. There was something on the plate. It was a head. I looked at it closely. No, wait. It was the head of the man who killed Ammi. 



He was dead. 



Who killed him? 



I felt my eyes stare at the plate as the rageful satisfaction settled in my heart. His face looked sad. I hoped he died in the most gruesome and barbaric way possible. But who was this woman? 



She stood before me, holding out the plate. I peeked inside the veil, and I saw Ammi's face smiling. "*I'm back, beta. Want to eat kheer today?*" I saw her, it was Ammi. I pulled the veil and saw her staring at me, *"Isn't this what you wanted?*" I gasped. "*A starry night*," she giggled and dropped the head on the floor. This couldn't be Ammi, no! 



I screamed. 



I screamed harder. 



I felt my throat burst as I ejected everything I was filled with. Satisfaction, anger, astonishment, despair, nothingness. Did I really want this? No, this is a dream, just a lucid dream. It didn't go as planned, but it's okay. I needed to leave. I got up and ran towards the door from where Ammi entered. My life flashed before me, and I got blinded by the light that illuminated my path. I didn't want to be blind. I wanted to see. I don't need a starry night. I just needed myself. I needed to get out. I ran. I ran!



A blackness flashed before me, and I saw glimpses of soft light. I opened my eyes slowly. I felt my bare body rub against wool as I rested on the fabric. I finally woke up, yes! It was a dream. But what was it? I couldn't remember. I felt my head weigh more than my entire body. The quilt around me felt like a Universe in which I resided. I hibernated. Yonder was the light that entered a window, a window outside the Universe. I didn't want to reach out. I couldn't remember my dream, but I felt empty and scarred. I looked up at the ceiling as I sighed and took a deep breath. I needed to get up.



The real world looked like a painting to me. 



For some reason, I had a terrible headache. I saw the walls of my house having a dark grey colour, and I felt them close in on me. Ammi is there, standing inside the kitchen, making kheer. It felt like a nice day, something that I would want. No, this was my world. This was reality. A reality that was itself utopian, something I wouldn't like to change or alter. No, this was something that was mine and only mine. But why was I feeling all this? Why did I want to hold on to a good reality so desperately? I looked at the mirror, and I stared right through me. I felt the glass panes betray me; something was wrong. No, it's fine.



I just woke up from a long dream, a really long dream. I looked up. My Ammi was serving the kheer. She was smiling at me. I saw Jamal sitting on a chair, feasting on the kheer. It was warm. It was happy. There was nothing wrong. I heard a knock on the door, which reverberated through the house. Who was it? Ammi opened the door, and a man entered. It was the same man, no, I had seen him. Yes, he killed Ammi in my dream. I remembered everything. But what was he doing there? No! Do not ruin my reality. He pulled out a knife. No. He slapped Ammi and undressed her. No! I screamed. I screamed. 



Jamal was crying. 



I screamed.



I opened my eyes and found myself dozing off on a chair. Wait? Was I dreaming again? What was it? I couldn't remember. Where was I? I couldn't remember. I felt my head hurt as I got up and looked out the window. Stars spread across the sheet of sky. It looked beautiful. I looked at my hands; they were red. Oh, I had to wash them, I remembered. I walked towards the sink. I washed my hands as the sink filled itself with water diluted with red and soaked all of it. It's okay. It's clean. But why did I have blood on my hands? Wait. I had seen this place, this house. I looked behind, and there was a table. On the table, there was a plate that reeked of kheer. Something was wrong. No, wait. Why did I know this place? What was I washing off? I looked at the mirror in front of me, and I screamed. 



I was the man from my dreams.
