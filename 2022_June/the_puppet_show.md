The last year witnessed some major changes like adapting from the online environment and witnessing a multitude of offline events and opportunities, thanks to our student representatives.

From handling the transition smoothly to launching full fledged initiatives, our student council worked towards constantly entertaining and providing opportunities for the community. It goes without saying that they deserve an enormous credit for all that they've accomplished.

Hence, we set to gather some of our deepest sources to present these resourceful comical social profiles for our representatives. Adding a little bit of an Udaan touch, join us as we unravel our most beloved student council.

## Secretaries

Starting from the elections to the end of their tenure, studies report that secretaries often feel like they have no idea what they're being blamed for. Their daily life includes waking up to get hit with a randomly tagged mail about the most random issues. The secretaries put tremendous effort throughout the year in ensuring a decent amount of the grand promises on the manifesto are fulfilled. Let's take a look at what our secretaries have to say about their experience.

**Most Commendable Achievements from his tenure as the SGS**           
From managing the campus bio-bubble and handling quarantine to containing the campus outbreak, he was instrumental in helping out the institute and students with regards to navigating those rough waters and resuming normal student activities on campus after almost 2 years. With a strong, progressive stand on student issues including hostel in-times, Dinkar has ensured smoother sailing for all students ahead.

**Dear Future Secretary,**                  
Try to approach the administration well in advance for issues students are facing or any proposal you have in mind. Last minute proposals are not taken into consideration because proper thought process can’t be put into them from the admin side.

Always take students into confidence about the decisions or discussions happening in institute level committees.

---------------------

*Thoughts and reviews from the student community*

> The most dedicated and hard-working guy who can get things done. One-man-army. One who knows EVERYTHING in IIT-T. A curious listener who will extract every bit of information from you. Never found in the room. Always ready for late-night parties.                        
>
>*-Arpit*


>No other student on campus has connected with everyone, be it security, staff, faculty or students as Dinkar has. As a consequence, no one else understands the working of the institute as well as him. No wonder then that he was involved in almost all decisions and committees the past year, be it COVID, Academics or HoME.     
>
>*-Shreyansh*

>A mastermind. He’s the mind you want to have in your team. His assurance and presence can give us the confidence to achieve few impossible tasks. A person with diverse mentality and a good friend. His greatest talent is his convincing skills and bold nature. He can literally convince any higher official with his words and can go against the whole institute if he feels it’s right. He did have a few accomplishments like successfully handling a protest(inside campus), lifting the restrictions of the girls' hostel and handling the situation of congestion in boys hostel during Covid time. These are actually enough to explain how greatly his tenure has been. Overall, he is everyone’s godfather.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure as AAS?**       
This was the academic year when ERP was intoduced in our college for the first time and all students began to use it for course registration. Since everyone including the academics section were new to it, it was really difficult for them as well as the students to use it smoothly. So a lot of issues arose during this period irrespective of the time. There were instances when I had to talk to Arun Sir and sort the issue out even at midnight. A lot of extensions in the deadline were requested. The drive was not smooth but was successful anyways. Although there were other issues with it, I was still happy that everyone registered successfully 😅.            

**Any regrets regarding your tenure?**       
I was not able to coordinate with my team well. Starting off with hybrid mode, there were no physical meetings, then the main problem was all the students who faced any kind of issue or doubts contacted me directly and I was unable to refuse to help them. Most importantly I wasn't  able to make them understand the process that had to be followed in order to sort out a query. I was hoping that they would stick to the correct workflow where the students could reach out to the CRs and their issues could be conveyed to the AAC members and then to me.                            

**Dear Future Secretary,**                          
Make sure you figure out and inform the students about how and whom to apprach in case of any queries or issues. Keep the CRs and the members of AAC in the loop, so that everyone will know the answer to common queries. This will make your work easier.

---------------------

*Thoughts and reviews from the student community*

>In a year which saw the institute transition back to offline classes and exams, we students couldn’t have asked for a better AAS than Tapish. A year or so of online functioning had seen a communication gap and friction appear between academics and the student body. Tapish bridged this gap, making sure that student grievances were put forward and redressed in a timely manner. With initiatives like a Career development Forum to connect students with their peers and alumni for guidance regarding higher education and placements, the impact of his tenure will be felt long after he’s left!            
>         
>*-Shreyansh*

>Tapish helped pull off something nearly impossible - modifying the timetable for the students interest in a system where EVERYONE says “I can’t do anything about this, please ask X”, and then X goes on to say the same! The guy can beat the odds with his talents. Kudos to him for doing wonders in spite of the difficult circumstances.       
>
>*-Debeshee*

>Here is one such person who bothered Tapish with all such doubts/queries he mentions above. 😅 But honestly none of the messages were left unanswered (Even when he was the Events Management Head). Getting such messages from everyone is truly overwhelming but you handled the situation like a pro. It was wonderful working with you as part of the AAC (probably didn’t do much). It was an awesome learning experience because of which I can now proudly say I know how certain things work in our college.

**What was the best part of being the RAS?**             
I learned how the administration process works in the institute. Democratically represented my views to the authorities without any coercion and I have maintained good cordial relations with the scholars, and the administration (Faculty & Staff). I thought the scholars who hadn't returned to the campus due to Covid restrictions wouldn't know my face, but surprisingly now they all are recognizing me without any acquaintance.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure as RAS?**  
I was always approachable to the scholars at any time either through phone or email. I was diligent to respond to their concerns and tried to resolve the dynamic issues with the help of concerned authorities.

I thank my research affairs council members & and our 2021-22 batch secretaries for their continuous support during my tenure.                              

**What do you wish you’d done differently?**       
Firstly, I had a wish to make every scholar happy with my representation, but in reality, it is impossible. Individual opinions always conflict with group interests. Finally, I  decided to prioritize group interests over individual opinions.

**Any mistakes that you want to warn your successors about?**             
Don't take any responsibility beyond your arm's length.

**Dear Future Secretary,**           
All the best!!!!               
Just go with the flow.

*Thoughts and reviews from the student community*

>He is a level-headed person. He maintained a good share of goodwill with research scholars and administration. This allowed him to put the concerns of the research scholars before the administration with much ease. He was also good at managing the team by delegating the work to the committee. I would say his term as the RAS was majorly hassle free.

>Suman has this beautiful, beautiful aura - you always feel like telling him your life problems, and he listens so sweetly, with the perfect facial expressions and responses, it often feels like he solves 68% of the problem, even if he can’t possibly do anything about it! And when it’s a problem he CAN do something about, he goes great lengths to get it done! He’s a true asset!       
>
>*-Debeshee*

>Suman is the most student friendly person I've come across who took immediate action to solve problems raised by the students. He is so polite and respects everyone, from the highest authority to the cleaning staff. He never gave up on students' interests. He believed in people working with him and gave them full freedom to work. I have never seen him taking a decision without discussing the issue with the seniors and the council members to come up with the best possible solution. I personally learned a lot from him and admire his work ethic.
All the best!!

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure ?**               
I was able to work with more dedication than I ever thought possible. Working with a great team and changing the mess tender is one of my great achievements.      

**Any Regerts or anything you wish you'd done differently?**
In the beginning of my tenure, I use to look into some unnecessary conversations happening around in the WhatsApp groups and other platforms and felt bad about the comments and stuff. Later I got habituated, people always say things. But I regret caring about this in the beginning.

Be open to suggestions and stay dedicated towards your work.

>When we returned to campus after the devastating second wave of the COVID-19 virus, the situation was chaotic; he inspired us with his hard-working nature and determined character. During the tenders for the mess contract, he worked and fought for the students to ensure we all got better food at a lower cost; he always tried to do his best in the students' favour. He ended his term on a high note by instituting ice cream night on campus and inspired not only our batch but also our junior batches to do their best in whatever duties they are responsible for.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure ?**      
- Finally purchased a good telescope for our insti!
- We started the first Tech Summit, a series of Intra IIT tech competitions (with the hopes of seeing this transform into a tech fest in the coming years)
- We setup the ideasquare room with most of the necessary equipment for students projects
- got some good industry colaborations
- Apart from that, the main challenge is getting students interested in these activities and clubs moving forward from the initial basic level stuff and start to work on more complex and advanced projects. We took the first step in solving this by revamping the club's org structure and introducing interest groups and tech teams.

**Any Regerts or anything you wish you'd done differently?**                
- Main regret is letting people who didn't know how to use the 3d printer use it. Here's a message for students: if are interested in something like 3d printing and you want to use the machine, better learn how to use it, no one is going to (and no one is expected to) do your work for you just because they are part of the club core. They can teach you, but not do your work for you!! lol.                  
- I also regret not getting the impressed budget plan for ideasquare (basically a monthly budget) approved in my tenure, but I do hope the next team will get it approved asap.               
- Another regret is definitely not being able to properly renovate the ideasquare room like we planned. Though that was mainly because of pressure from above.                                
- One last thing is I didn't give any goodies for students who won in Intra IIT Tech summit when all others did (we did give prize money though).      
- Even though this one is not on us, the online Inter IIT Tech Meet was unfortunately a big flop due to the unethical way it was organized. Hope it didn't demotivate anyone. Never let IIT KGP organize anything ever again or simply don't participate in the events they organize (We have seen the toxic culture they follow and how it reflects in the events they organize way too many times.
- Apart from this I feel like I didn't oversee the activities of Digital Wizards and E-Cell as I was a bit too busy with Techmaniacs, Ideasquare and Gagan Vedhi. While the Digital Wizards team did a phenomenal job the E-cell team utterly failed in organising even a single event to promote entrepreneurship, which was reflected even in many of director's remarks. In retrospect I should have helped them more and focused more on that side as well.

**Dear Future anybody who takes up a tech-related POR,**    
- One suggestion will be for clubs' core teams to focus on actually doing projects (which will help their CVs as well) rather than simply organizing workshop after workshop every month, all the KT stuff needs to happen within the first month of the joining of first years, and later on the focus should be on projects and clearing doubts for freshers.
- Regular open house to show these projects should also be organized. This way other students will also be able to see what all they can do if they join the club later. Moreover, more visibility a club gets through the projects they work on, it will definitely help in many ways like getting more budget, more collabs with companies etc.. (What you show is what you get).
- Also one way to maximize audience is by having fewer but more marketed and inclusive events like the Tech summit. Try to get outside speakers like entrepreneurs etc... to these events, as next year one of the main focus areas for TAC and E-cell will be to properly setup the startup pre-incubation hub and motivate entrepreneurship more among students.

>This guy is full of ideas and loves to work on them! You can go to him and strike up a conversation on any idea, and he always has plenty to say! And he has very specific preferences and ways of doing things, and tries his best to get them implemented wherever he can. He cycled through all the To-Do list apps on the play store until he found one he could work with! He's also a really good team player, and makes sure that all the work he takes up gets done well.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure ?**           
The first big cultural event that we celebrated in college after the COVID break was Diwali. The institute was calling students back in batches and our team was not completely on campus by then, so the transition and communication was a little tough along with the COVID restrictions but at the end of the day, we were happy with how everything worked out as we got positive feedback from the students.         

One of the most heartwarming moments was from the Signature day event conducted for the graduating students. We knew the event was a success once we saw their faces and overheard them saying “badia cheez hai bhai!!” with joy.                       

One of my favourite events was Christmas. For the first time it was celebrated over two days and many students enthralled us with their talents!                            

**Dear future secretary,**              
Well, we always try to give our best for every event. But it's important to listen to the feedback after the event and improve on it in the next instance.

**What was the best part of being the SS ?**      
Best part of being any secretary is the ability to bring changes. The fact that I was able to get jerseys for everyone who participated in Kridaan is one thing I am really proud of. Also there were instances where the previous Intra IIT was halted due to fights among students (not the sole reason). I am proud of the fact that we conducted Kridaan in the most peaceful manner. Students took everything with a sporting spirit. And we saw commendable participation from  women as well. This lays a good foundation for the next inter IIT Tournaments.

**What do you wish you’d done differently?**   
- Budget Planning. Plan for everything from the beginning. I couldn’t get this done because of the online-offline ambiguity. However the funds were approved later. But doing this before is less complicated.    
- E-sports is another aspect I lost track of. I hope the next secretary launches and lays foundation for this gaming culture.

**Dear future secretary,**             
Learn negotiating and management skills. I learnt it the hard way. Being too polite doesn’t work. Fight for what needs to be done and be assertive and confident. Take a stand and convince people. At the end of the day, this is a learning experience.

>Being in a POR during the pandemic time has been a tricky job for all, but I believe that even with the hurdles, he has been one of the best sports secretaries our college has ever seen. Conducting winter sports tournament, Kridan, and other tournaments successfully with a little experience is a great accomplishment. These tournaments have improved both in terms of conducting and participation. From my first year till now, I have seen an increase in the number of people showing up for playing sports. Not only in terms of conducting these events, I feel that he has also done well in managing his committee and bringing in new reforms, like the hall of fame, etc. Though it is not possible right now, I would have loved to watch our college get some real wins in Inter-IIT under his leadership.

>An adventurer. After he was elected as a sports secretary, I was worried how he would take up the resposiblity because being the SS is not easy. Selecting me as part of the sports council, further enhanced my doubts on him. But after being a member of his council i got an oppurtunity to witness first hand the way he planned various activities, and events. This changed my opinion of him. Organizing KRIDAN followed by prize distribution ceremony on Gymkhana day is a mind-blowing situation that has left me perplexed.Kudos!! He is a person who takes pride in his work and make sure it never fails at any cost. Most important of all, he’s a hard-worker and a great friend.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure ?**     
If I had to mention my most important achievement, that would be the LAC. Everyone in the LAC is interested and have contributed to lots of activities in their own way, and while I can't take credit for their existence and their awesomeness, I will take credit for assembling this passionate little team! We had meetings every once in a while and we came up with a bunch of ideas, most of which never saw the light of reality. But the few ideas that did, did have a lasting impact. And I believe that's important, because it encourages ideation and reinforces the belief that any idea can come to fruition if we diligently work towards it!              

One example is "Have we met before": the first ever event that the LAC as a whole had organized. While the primary aim of the event was to increase the senior-junior interaction in the online mode, there was another agenda: to organize a large scale event that would bring the newly formed LAC together. While the idea of the event was inspired from the "Icebreaker session" held in December 2020, the planning, organization and execution took a complete detour. The event was organized on Discord and all the participants were divided into teams of 5-7, among which there was a volunteer who engaged the team and held activities. The amount of planning that went into it was insane! And I think that the success of that event set the environment for everything that followed.                  

The year was full of challenges, but the most important one was getting work done while involving more people. I often came across cases where I could just take up all the work myself and get it done, but doing so wouldn't have been inclusive to people. I believe that it's important to involve people in work, sometimes even at the cost of finishing the work, to build a team, and I'm proud of the fact that I continuously tried to align my actions to this belief as much as I could. And I believe that helped!          

**What do you wish you’d done differently?**     
I did take a lot of decisions that I would consider mistakes, in the sense that I could've made other choice that lead to better outcomes. However, I don't think I would change any of that, and I couldn't have as well, because the past me couldn't have known any better, and I wouldn't be the same person I am now!

**Dear Future Secretary,**             
If there's one thing, that is to "remember your role". The Literary Affairs Secretary is a student representative i.e. the LAS must represent the students' interests. The LAS isn't a CEO, they mustn't represent their own ideas all the time (doesn't mean they must refrain from doing it at all). The LAS isn't a boss, they do not have the right to boss around people and get work done (they do reserve the right to kick people off the LAC though). The LAS must understand the role of the representative and act like one, and this must reflect in all their actions.                               

I used the word "LAS" above, but I believe this applies for all the student representatives. All the above isn't a written rule. This is my perspective and I believe I stood by it!

1. Core dream offer policy - allowing students placed in non-core companies to use their dream offer for core companies irrespective of the package details.       
2. 6 month internship - framing a way in which students can do 6 month intern in core companies alongside their academics. This increased the number of core opportunities in the institute.              
3. Formation of sub teams for the career development activities namely - <br>

**Any Regerts? or anything you wish you'd done differently?**    
Improper planning of Student Repository and maintaining it.

**Dear Future Placement Coordinator,**                  
Maintain the repository from the very beginning.                                     
Before students sit for any company, connect them with the just graduated batch students who are placed in that company.

>His term was just after the second wave of Corona. I've seen him work hard for the placement of each and every student. There are people who exploit the power given to them but he knew exactly how to balance everything. He'd be bold while negotiating with the companies to come to the college and he had even spoken to a lot of them which none of the previous Placement Coordinators had ever done. All in all my respect for him as a friend, human and roommate grew over time as I saw him succeed.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure ?**
One of the proudest moments for me personally was when all my batchmates, especially my friends received their internship offer. This had seemed like a distant dream at the beginning of my tenure. When I received emails about shortlists and people's selection, it felt like one more step towards the summit on sending them the "Congratulations!" mail. Also when few students gave their thanks for the CDC sessions and mock rounds, it felt great that all our genuine efforts towards helping the students was being appreciated.

**Any Regerts or anything you wish you'd done differently?**   
Since this was the first time IGC position was brought into the Secretariat, along with the positives and the great things that happened throughout the year, one thing that I would want to do differently would be to make the students more aware about the global scenario we are living in and also to do justice to students who think that they were at a disadvantage because of me.

>So, I met Amit on my second day at college, and from that day till now, I find him highly hardworking in all the fields he works in. We even call him a "robot" for his dedication. He likes to help others; He is my coding guru and a great friend. He is all set to be the next Satya Nadela, and I am sure he will be. He knows how to work under pressure and manage a team, so I would say he was and is the best person to be IGC. He is very caring and his favourite sweet is ras malai, something he loves more than coding or helping others.
>
>*-Aditya*

>Even though IGC position was introduced for the first time, I felt that Amit did justice to the position. He used to communicate about everything on time and the queries were being resolved very quickly. He created a timeline for all the company events that would take place so that it would be useful for the students. Regular reminders were sent regarding different companies' application processes. We can even see that 150+ students have got internships which is a big number.

**What was the best part about being GCU Head?**           
The best part of being the GCU student head was to hear the word "Thank you" in a low soft voice when people express their journey either to us directly or when we become their mediator in arranging counseling sessions. It just gives a feeling of being noble and helpful amidst all the chaotic things I find myself involved into. A breath of fresh air, a pat at my own back. Those feelings are lovely!   

**What were your most commendable achievements?**                                                                               
It was creating solid steps for creating awareness about mental health and remove taboos regarding counseling. I am proud that by the end of my tenure my council had set a stern foundation for the functioning of GCU which was a challenge given the hybrid scheme of things going on in our life. And as you know when you have the basement ready, several floors can be added into that building!

**Do you have any regrets regarding your tenure?**                                                      
I wish I could have been better in assigning tasks to my team members so as to make them more involved in the work. And would have included more members in the council to have more fun based activities in the campus from GCU side.

**Dear Future Head,**         
Do lead your team by example but do ensure every member in your council is involved in the tasks assigned to them. At times, I took charge of tasks allotted to a part of my council. It resulted in their apprehension that Aasim will do it. Try to ensure full cooperation with Dr. Pooja V. She is  the actual driving force for the resurgence of this unit.

-------------------------

*Thoughts and reviews from the student community*

>Aasim is a hard worker who is willing to give everything he has to the tasks that have been assigned to him. As GCU head for the 2021–22 academic year, one of his goals was to increase GCU's reputation among IITT family members and promote the GCU motto to encourage those in need of assistance to go ahead and seek it with confidence. Another challenge was to spread awareness about GCU's presence, which he attempted to do by planning several student seminars and developing the Sarathi website and Instagram account. Since maintaining privacy is of the biggest importance for a GCU student head, I have personally observed him considering how he could assist people while maintaining complete anonymity. He gave it his all to create the GCU constitution, which will serve as a guide for all the new members. I recall an instance when a person published an anonymous Instagram post about an incident that happened, Aasim took the initiative of asking for information about it with the intention of offering assistance and support. I'd want to wrap up by saying that the entire GCU team, including the faculty advisor Pooja ma'am, put a lot of effort towards helping people and eradicating stigma surrounding mental health throughout the previous academic year.
>
>*-Dinkar*

>Search for qualities of a good counsellor and you'll get good listener, patient, observant, compassion as the go-to traits. Aasim embodies these. Even more, he embodies dedication and in a year where students and faculty were reeling mentally from the worst of Covid, GCU needed someone like him at the helm to guide all those who needed help.

## Coordinators

Apart from the mail where coordinators are announced, research finds no name of coordinators in any credit forum. They take care of everything from handling all the technical work to constantly improving the club and its policies, organising a new set of events and revamping the old events and also avoiding empty promises of prize money. Phew! Its high time we give them the well deserved recognition.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure as the coordinator?**                             
'Just Classical Indian Things' was an initiative designed to present classical music, through music, story telling and visuals, in a way that was alluring to people from our generation who were not familiar with it formally. The participants, around 10 of us enjoyed it immensely, and the audience feedback was really warm and unforgettable! The challenges were that we were in online mode and everyone had time constraints and professional commitments to balance.

We had collaborated with PFC on the project, and I was very happy with how everyone involved in it was glad to be a part of the experience. Apart from this, putting the Sargam band back together and performing on Ethnic Night in spite of the logistic issues was incredibly memorable!

**Any regrets or changes you wish you could make?**                      
The process of making purchases, especially expensive equipment, is not clear to most people. Anyone can be misled. It's best to double check the directions you are given and check with someone higher up in the admin in case anything seems unusual.

In general, I made the mistake of trusting other people to do their job well and it didn't work out a few times. It's best to be mentally prepared for the unexpected and come up with a back up plan.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                           
Anything involving the admin takes time so start reaching out well in advance. Having a permanent safe space for both Sargam's instruments and its people is long overdue - I hope it can be arranged soon.

I think my team tackled the online offline transition really well, even though everyone had very little time to adjust. We made a short film and the Freshers' Introduction Video entirely online and also conducted many contests. Then we came to the campus and tirelessly covered Tirutsava (and various other events), sleeping just 3 hours a day. I'm really proud of my team for giving their hundred percent to everything the club did.

**Any regrets or changes you wish you could make?**                    
A lot of students were very enthusiastic about workshops regarding photography and DSLRs. We tried to make it happen but the offline semester was too stacked with events that we had to cover. We're eagerly looking forward to fix this in the upcoming academic year.

It's often the case for most clubs that the club coordinator keeps motivating the core team and takes things forward, but for PFC, it felt like the entire core team supported each other very well, encouraging the coordinator to put in more efforts. It's quite a challenge to keep up the standards that the PFC has set over the years, and covering all college events consistently isn't an easy task, but Anant and team have done a really good job at that! Watching them work, to be honest, is quite inspiring.

Offline events! I didn’t think they would work out and that barely ten people would show up because not many people find art to be fun and truly relate to it. Not everyone gets it right?  But there were over 40 people! (Which was a little bit annoying because too many people is too much work, lol!) But it was awesome because everyone enjoyed the events. Especially the freshers. The team was amazing with marketing. They made sure more people would join us for events. I did feel very proud of our team, looking at everyone having a great time with  arts.

**Any regrets or changes you wish you could make?**                                             
Covid gave us no time at all to actually get the students more deeply involved in Artista. I could've done something about that but we already had too many events lined up because of Tirutsava , Fiesta and 75 years.

In college life experienced till now, getting into the dance core team in the first year itself and being a part of crew that represented our college in 2019 Inter IIT cultural meet. I have participated in both group and duo competition.

**Any regrets or changes you wish you could make?**                                 
I feel I should have made it more interactive. Primarily having few online and few offline made it difficult to conduct events adding to my prime procastination. Always have a to do list with specific deadlines.
And as for managing the work: should have distributed the work and assigned to the core team according to the appropriate time. This keeps the work system of club smooth. So always having the schedule of club planned and shared with core team helps in coordination.                              

**Dear Future Coordinator,**             
Bringing in the people, being on time when we schedule an events motivates the people. Maintaining this helps in having organising the event and calling in others and enquiring what problems others are facing without delaying the plans.

I know these are all hangover thoughts after any fictional movie but what if there actually is a person who bears storm inside but still manages to win a lemon spoon race. Not only does he grooves with his limbs but also makes everyone's minds swirl. And who could actually do better than our xcite club coordinator, D. Ajay. This karimnagar boy became my first hang after coming to IITT. There is nothing special about him but he is an addiction! Usually expressionless but that vibe is priceless. After a dreary dusty day if you aspire for a person you really want to talk to- Its Ajay. A gifted listener, he has no demands-no expectations. This makes him extremely likeable, approachable and an interesting personality. This hide and seek lover has 100 tasks when I sleep and zero when I wake up. I have no clues how he manages chores. I guess that is why he is an excellent leader. He doesnt think leadership is about ordering people. Its more of involving them, living the experiences with them and teaching them the ways he knows to the best of his talent. You meet this person once and you can never forget the spark he carries for his life, be it family, friends, academics, extracurricular and XCITE.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure?**                   
Probably organizing the club mail handle and drive folder (Yes… Prabhat level documentation + Debeshee level organization). No offense to the previous coordinators, but the place was a mess. Jokes aside, probably the fact that we managed to conduct many debate and oratory sessions and participated in several inter college competitions makes me sooper proud and happy.

**Any regrets or changes you wish you could make?**                                   
One small regret is the fact that I came to know about this facebook page Indian Parliamentary Debate Calendar (which kinda has posts about every single debate competition in the country) after the first half of the year. Had I known of its existence before,  I’m sure we could have participated in several inter collegiate events in the odd semester as well.            

Other than this I pretty much enjoyed every single moment in the Debate and Oratory Club. With an awesome core team, even awesome trio of debate mentors and the best Literary sec ever there were no chance for regrets.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                                     
People sign up to be part of the core team initially, because why not? Vacation time, not much academic related work and become a no-show later on. A friendly advice, recruit people who are active debaters. Because as a debate and oratory club core memeber there's really not much manegerial work other than, of course host sessions. Also try to do conduct activities in collaboration with the CDC.
All The Best!!!!

>Sneha has done an absolutely amazing job at heading the debate and oratory club. There have been numerous numerous debates which have been held in her term, and she has also ensured that no one gets left out due to any lack of knowledge. She has made sure everyone has access to all the sources they can improve themselves when it comes to debates. She is also incredibly knowledgeable in debate and was the perfect choice for coordinator of debate club.
>
>*-Sathya*

>The very first day for the debate, she managed to bring someone who had completely given up on debate and speaking in front of an audience(me), back into the game. That was perhaps the main, very impressive achievement in my eyes. Amidst the massive ships (other clubs), the debate club felt like a dinghy (owing to its size and other people's interest in joining or even looking at it). But with Sneha at the helm, we knew sinking was not one of the possible outcomes. Probably the only concern is that the debate club is usually revered as the most popular club in many colleges and over here, it felt like it never reached its full glory (this could be chalked up to many reasons but I believe the club head plays a part too).
>

>Sneha is an institution! The consistency, grit, radical spirit and emotional strength to back it all up, apart from the obvious oratory, literary and people skills, is just awe-inspiring. I sometimes wish I could be her. Hands down!

>*-Debeshee*

>An extremely sweet person at heart, but extremely intimidating in the first interaction. Everyone I knew was initially scared of Sneha, and it's probably her bold but unique way of talking, I was never able to figure out why! And it's not just the way she talks, she's bold and confident in her actions too. And her work ethic is very inspiring. She does way too many things at a time, and till date, I have no idea how she manages to do justice to all of them!
On a work related personal note, she's very focused and a quick learner. I received a lot of help from her when I was LAS, and I knew that if she was taking care of something, I could rest easy and be assured that it would go well!

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure?**                              
For me, the best part of being the Quiz Club head was the rewarding experience of creating an event that is received well by the participants. All the hours of research and planning with the core team felt worth-it when I looked at the participants and saw them enjoying tackling the set of questions that we had created. Another good thing about being the coordinator is planning events with other clubs and for major cultural events like Fiesta and Tirutsava.                    

The thing I am most proud of was conducting four quizzes in four consequent weeks during Tirutsava and Fiesta. During this time, the events received good participation and many talented quizzers were identified in the institute.                                                           

**Any regrets or changes that you wish you could make?**                     
I think the structure of the club and the planning could have been better. We were short a few members in the core team who could help in creating quizzes. With more members, the planning could have been better and we could have conducted more events more regularly.
Apart from what I have said about the structure, a social media presence of the club should be established. The Instagram page needs to be active. The club could do with more visibility.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                           
Congratulations on becoming the new head! There are many talented quizzers who joined the club last year. I believe that you will have active participation in the events and more enthusiasm about quizzing in the next year. And make sure to build a good team for the Inter-IIT, Nihilanth and other inter-college competition. I wish you the best. Good Luck!

>I have worked with Ayush for the past 3 years on multiple course projects and also our final year project. He has a great sense of humor, a very curious mind, and is always trying to push himself to get better. He worked really hard and devoted a lot of time to making the quizzes fun and interesting and knowledgeable for everyone participating, despite him being quite busy with his BTP and also his grad school applications. Despite these he has conducted some wonderful quizzes. This goes to show his excellent time-management skills. All these qualities have helped him to have a great tenure as quiz club coordinator.     
>
>*-Nirmal*  

>When I joined the quiz club I had almost no experience in making quizzes, Ayush guided me and my fellow core members in framing quizzes to the best level possible. For the most of the year we were a team of 4, but this didn't stop us from limiting the number of quizzes. We ended up framing around 200 questions for 13 quizzes thrughout the year and the best part was it wasn't hectic on us. We couldn't ask for a better head than Ayush.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure?**                            
During my tenure, we conducted many contests and workshops, but my favorite would be the DSA series. During this, we did all the data structures and algorithmic techniques, and students who participated in the series were pleased with its outcome. I feel the success or failure of an event depends not on the number of participants but the value added to their life during the event. And as per our feedback, we were able to add some value to the participants...                              

**Any regrets or changes that you wish you made?**                  
My biggest regret would be not being able to conduct more offline workshops for freshers.

>Sharmaji is the most well-loved person you can find in a 100 mile radius. He’s disarming, unassuming, incredibly good with people, not to mention the hardcore technical credentials one would expect from the Code Club Head. It is an absolute pleasure working with him and watching him navigate unprecedented challenges without breaking a sweat. He’s also a gold star when it comes to the friendship lottery!

Always building from ground up and giving into his goal everything that he has, whether it was to learn coding from scratch to becoming the top coder of our college or to run the Digital Wizard Code Club and lead it and manage it in the best way guiding students to reach their greatest or to get the best position possible for us by leading the Inter IIT Tech Meet, he keeps his goal ahead of him and marches towards it, jutsuing his way like Naruto, with full speed and determination listening to The Weekend on loop with a smile on his face ;)

Tirutsava Robosphere participation is unexpectedly large. Observed interesting designs and took it with great interest. The participants were putting in efforts.           

**Any regrets or changes that you wish you made?**                                  
1. In the beginning, the club thought that workshops were the way to go and get the beginners started. But these are just basics and not a full fledged series.
2. Project driven learning which might help for inter IIT with problem statements.
3. We did not have that much outreach and experience to learn from seniors.
4. Funding was not time.
5. Because of time, we could not do as many things as planned.
6. Online mode also introduced a gap. The transition was bad for mechanical because of pending labs.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                         
Technical culture in our IIT is weaker than expected. Our college’s culture should develop and our performance should also match.

**What was the best part about being a Club Head?**                           
Sense of achievement. After sharing any resources, conducting any activity or posting something related to astronomy, I always felt a bit satisfied by the fact that even though a bit, we were able to improve everyone’s understanding of our ‘home’.                   

Well, being a club head has its perks, you get to know some amazing people from other colleges, companies and startups as well. And as a by-product, you get some recognition too :P              

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure? What is the thing you’re most proud of?**      
Introducing computational astronomy as an interest group.We live in a data-driven world, all you see around produces tons of data and so do the telescopes and space probes. Applying various algorithms and extracting important features from the data is what it’s mainly about.                          

We conducted a hands-on workshop on ‘AI with space applications’ in collaboration with Spaceonova. Some more resources were shared with students to get a better insight. This has now formed the base for all other related activities that might take place shortly.                                                             

Also, this year we managed to submit a solution under the same domain in Inter IIT Tech meet 10.0 for ISRO’s web-based automatic identification of solar bursts in x-ray light curves and received recognition for the same on Gymkhana day.                              

**Do you have any regrets?**                    
The thing which I wish I had done differently was mentoring students for the NASA space apps challenge. It’s a hackathon that’s conducted every year by NASA. We did prepare step-by-step guides with links to resources but somehow it didn’t go well. Post analysis made us realize that the main reason was the lack of interaction between the core team and participating individuals.

**Dear future Coordinator,**                                          
Never neglect the importance of regular interaction. During my tenure, I realized that people pay more attention and participate well when you interact with them regularly and keep the communication platforms active. It might sound a bit hard to execute at first but with proper division and management it becomes easier with time and it’s truly worth it.                    

Even though my tenure ends now, I’ll keep on supporting the club and its activities. So don’t hesitate if you want some assistance or want to have a chat with someone who is equally enthusiastic about space. I’ll be there. Most important, don’t be ever discouraged by low participation. It happens and I know that. I would suggest trying different types of activities. Quizzes and talk shows are great but trying something new or doing it in a different way will most likely increase participation.                                  
Best wishes from my side. Let’s take our club to the next level!                 

*PS: To all the enthusiasts out there, your interest and participation is of utter importance. So, if you’re free on a Saturday night and while scrolling you came across something new, share it with others.. have a discussion on it. Let’s build a strong space community where we learn and thrive together. Our club is there for you to make this journey beautiful, all you have to do is show your interest.*

>Devansh, you are an embodiment of humbleness; not only humbleness but also skill and sincerity😇 . I haven't seen any other student like you. You never hurt, insult or disrespect anyone. I have never seen you in anger, despite provoking situations. It was a great pleasure working under you in Astronomy club 🤗. Your creativity is superb which was reflected from the ideas you proposed when you were on the throne👑 of head of Astro club. You never enforced responsibility on anyone, and did an ideal distribution of work equally among everyone, keeping into account the academic pressure everyone has. Also, your spontaneity and pragmatic thinking was visible when you used to point out the minute but serious loopholes in our ideas within seconds🫰🏻.  Also I love your way of conveying others mistakes to them- no sarcasm, no exaggeration, no pride- only shear politeness😄. How do you manage this?!
Being very friendly with us you were also strict about ethics. You always discharged the core members from using copyright restricted materials and thoroughly examined these things. You speak less but meaningful, never wasting your and others' time. I learnt a lot from you ( including some stuff related to coding :) )
I am really lucky to have a friend like you.
>
>*-Pranav Sutar*

>My college friend Devansh, he is not only a hard-working studious person, yet in addition brimming with warm friendship as well. He is extremely enthusiastic about programming and in fact, he had been in the top five in many of the contests conducted in our college. He is super passionate about astronomy. He has a true passion for the space related stuff, such that he would always go and learn or read more about any topic related to the astronomy. The management strategy of his studies and the coordinator-ship of the astronomy club should be admired and I have personally observed him the way he manages both of them simultaneously. Despite any issue, be it participation, or any mishap during an event, he never looses his chill and never ever been in despair and continues conducting club events. In particular, he would spend a significant amount of time for the club, planning  events, arranging meetings, and researching  topics to be posted on the club's page. Not only this, but as a person he so generous, he is just always ever-ready to help anyone. He is one of the most reliable people you can count on. He is arguably my closest companion.

**What was the best part about being Club Head to you?**
Leading a bunch of good guys (mostly nerds :p) who have a similar interest and sometimes even failing to do a good job at it. But the main part was learning from the experience and applying it again.

**What is your most commendable achievement from your tenure?**                      
Restarting the club from (almost) non-existence due to the pandemic and rejuvenating it with a great team. Hopefully the new lads will take it much forward than I could.

**Any regrets regarding your tenure?**                     
I wish I could have spent more energy on getting the work completed, rather than being happy seeing the work in the progress.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                      
I would warn the successors of becoming lethargic after achieving small milestones, this club requires the team to strive hard untill the final result (fs car) is rolled out! Build up on the little foundation that we tried as a team and make IIT Tirupati family proud. Keep the grind on!

>
>*-Sibi*

>After a long break due to the pandemic, the automobile club assembled a new team and resumed work on the design of their race car. Saurabh Suryawanshi, a 4th-year ME student and a motorsport enthusiast led the project and the club. He assigned the newcomers to the different subsystems headed by old members of the club who had worked on the car before the lockdown. By holding frequent meetings and maintaining high morale, he ensured that the work picked up the pace. The project reached major milestones before it was halted by the third COVID wave. The chassis design was brought to near completion. The engine team finalised the schematics of many subsystems like intake and exhaust, powertrain and cooling and the procurement of the parts was started. In the little time that the club has had together on the floor, Saurabh was also very pivotal in maintaining the communication between teams. With the establishment of a new core in the club and impressive progress, Saurabh has primed the club to complete the car in the next year under a new coordinator.

**Please tell us about the best part of being Head.**                        
Being head you get to work along with new people. The best part is those people become your good friend at end of the year and you create a lot of memories and a lot of new experiences. Being head of the Aranya club taking students to trek and enjoy along with carrying responsibility is what excited me a lot.

**What was your biggest achievement during your tenure?**                      
Usually, Aranya conducts treks with 120-140 students but this year just after covid guidelines get relaxed we conducted a trek with 240 people on board with 0 injuries/ unpleasant accidents.

**Do you have any regrets or changes that you wish you had made?**                       
As we spent most of the academic year online I wish I could have spent more time with club activities and club members in person. I think I should have conducted one more trek and introduced at least one new adventure sport.                               

When it comes to Aranya club which is an adventure sports club there are tons of risks involved while conducting a any event. I would recommend recruiting club core members with some adventure sport experience.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                     
Aranya club for now is being limited to very few adventure sports there is still a lot to explore and introduce. It's one of the favorite club of students. You will enjoy being head of this club. Good luck with your journey as club head.

**What was your most commendable achievement from your tenure?**                       
We as a club had some really good moments last year. We played a lot of intercollege tournaments and were performing on par with the clubs of some top colleges. We had a top-3 finish in 3-4 events in which close to 12 colleges participated. Also in terms of number of people participating within the club, some of our most participated events are CPL and Battle of Branches where we received participation of about 30 and 50 respectively.                                                                     

**Please tell us if you have any regrets before leaving.**                    
One of my regrets will be that we weren't able to get the prize money that we would have wanted for the club. We at the start of the had made some plans about having some events and we made our budget according to that but as that didn't happen we had to pivot from there. Also one other thing is that we thought we will be able to get more people interested in playing chess. We tried a few things to aiming towards new comers but now I feel maybe we could have tried a bit more in that direction.

I would like to write this short piece to thank him for taking up this responsibility which ~~he was forced into and daily dreaded waking up early in the morning for~~ he took up out of the goodness of his heart and, over the year, was able to successfully "oversee all the activities under the club and ensure a smooth flow of events".     
>
>First, a bit about the man himself. To begin with, ~~he is/was/hopefully still is ripped~~ Vraj is a person who is always there for his friends no matter what and a very approachable and fun guy to chat with at that. He is dedicated to tasks (he actually sets his mind on) and goes above and beyond to get them done. This was clear to me during his term as the coordinator, especially during the yoga week celebrations when he woke up early in the morning for days on end (trust me, he is not a morning person) to ensure the event went without any hiccups. He also organised regular events over the semester to keep the club active and did his best to encourage people to join (sadly couldn't persuade me) and provide them with everything they would need to have a good experience as a club member.     
>

**What is your most commendable achievement during your tenure?**                              
As the Head of E-Cell of IIT Tirupati, I got to understand that the main challenge in our IIT is to gain popular support and the interest of our students towards something new.
I can proudly with my team, say that this year we all succeeded in increasing the engagement of our students interested in entrepreneurship by 3 times on our social platforms like Instagram and Discord.
In addition, We succeeded in grabbing the participation in our events, webinars and workshops to a good level.
Also, we also got an opportunity to redirect a few Startup Ideas to their Preincubation Level. Still I felt that, only the students who were interested in Entrepreneurship and startups, most of the time turned up, till the last times for which the count has increased.
Overall, It was a Great Experience to be the Head of Entrepreneurship Cell Of IIT Tirupati.
I got a chance to talk and understand how the managers of Big Startups actually work and what Entrepreneurship actually mean apart from the typical definition.

**Do you have any regrets from the past year?**                                 
When it comes to mistakes, I feel that a few times, I got unprofessional in choosing the type of workshops or webinars, that I had organized. My motive should be to include new students also but because of that reason sometimes I did injustice to the already in people and vice versa.

**Dear Future Coordinator,**                                 
Coordinate with your team members properly, Focus on the masses not the few one out there, and try to create a cult of Entrepreneurs in our college and please be always in touch of the previous heads whenever you need any piece of advice or suggestion...Best of Luck to all of you.
