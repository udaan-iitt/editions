desc: Greek Goddess of Spring and ruler of the underworld, Persephone, was
  kidnapped by Hades, the god of the dead, and forced to wed him against her
  will. She later remained with him, but she spent six months of the year on
  Earth and six months in the underworld, depending on the narrative. We share
  fall and winter while she is in the underworld and spring and summer when she
  is on the surface. Zeus, her father and the Sky God and King of Olympus,
  arranged the above to reconcile Demeter, the Goddess of
  Agriculture, and Hades.

abio: "If you ask a friend of Iftekar’s to describe him, the first word that
  will helplessly tumble out of their mouth is ‘poet’. The soft-spoken poet, who
  radiates positive vibes and wields excellent oratory skills, Iftekhar, is
  currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT
  Tirupati. He is also a well-known badminton player who spends his spare time
  immersed in books and movies. "

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Oh! Persephone, today I ask, <br>
What do you want to be? <br>
Want to choose pleasant spring, <br>
Or Queen of underworld thing? </p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">If you choose the underworld throne,<br>
Then deny all your claim upon us,<br>
Deny those beautiful scented flowers,<br>
So no lover can pluck them for 'Her',<br>
Deny those young green leaves,<br>
So none ever see the colour green. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
If you choose to be queen of Hades,<br>
Then let the Horai rule over us, <br>
Let the winter turn everything grey,<br>
Let the rains flood every Hamlet,<br>
Let the Summer burn entire hay,<br>
And autumn will make fall every leaf. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
But if you choose the spring crown, <br>
Then break your Netherworldly shackles, <br>
Then prison those horrible Horais, <br>
So there's no other season but spring,<br>
Then fill this world with infinite colours,<br>
So this Quadrachromic world scares none. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
But if you leave underworld horrific,<br>
Then divorce deathly Hades for good,<br>
And embrace the role of spring's Angel,<br>
So, that your brightness, whole world sees, <br>
Let bloom, roses, daisies and daffodils, <br>
So, poets see emotions of your every shade. </p>
