Salesforce visited our campus as part of its Futureforce intern hiring program. I applied for the position of Software Engineering Intern and was lucky enough to get the offer. The interview process was very smooth and all the interviewers were very kind. 

My eight-week journey began on 15th May 2023, in the bustling city of Hyderabad. The first week started with an exceptional onboarding process. This week not only provided valuable insights into Salesforce's culture but also equipped me with the essentials for a successful internship, including setting up my laptop, understanding the various teams, receiving lots of swags 🤩, and getting introduced to Salesforce's unique 1-1-1 model. An office tour was a crucial part of this initiation, as navigating the vast three-building office complex could otherwise be a daunting task.

As my internship progressed, Salesforce made sure to balance work with an enjoyable environment. With a strong emphasis on work-life balance, it's an unspoken rule at the company—no work on weekends. This commitment to well-being, as reiterated by my mentor, helped me maintain a healthy work-life equilibrium, ensuring I approached each day with renewed enthusiasm and focus. 

In addition to my regular work, I participated in various intern events that encouraged networking among peers. Salesforce's culture is built on keeping employees happy, evident through initiatives like swag distribution, VTO (Volunteer Time Off) events, Sports Day, and Futurefest. Fun is not only encouraged in your daily work but also celebrated as a means to create impactful solutions. When work is infused with fun, magic happens! 

I also had the opportunity to interact with esteemed business leaders, including Arundhati Bhattacharya, Salesforce India's Chairman and CEO, Vinod Shah, VP of Software Engineering, and Michele Nyrop, a senior ES leader. These interactions were invaluable and helped me to learn more about the Salesforce ecosystem and the challenges and opportunities facing the industry.

One of the most fantastic aspects of my internship was the abundance of learning opportunities provided by my colleagues and mentors. I learned a lot from working on real-world projects and from the guidance and support of my mentors. Informal interactions with my colleagues during problem-solving sessions or casual conversations about Xbox in the social lounge contributed to my personal and professional growth. 

At Salesforce, teamwork and support are fundamental values. Co-workers readily shared their expertise and resources to help each other succeed. Apart from office work, my team members used to recommend new restaurants and places to explore in Hyderabad. Salesforce's vibrant culture extended beyond the office, with numerous team outings and celebrations that brought colleagues closer together. Engaging in sports activities, such as foosball, table tennis, and pool, became a fantastic way to unwind and foster camaraderie with my colleagues.

Additionally, giving back to the community is core to Salesforce's culture. Even during my limited time there, I discovered several volunteering opportunities organized by the office. I participated in Seed Ball making, Gratitude Graffiti, and other exciting activities. Salesforce employees are encouraged to participate in philanthropic activities through Volunteer Time Off.

Overall, my internship at Salesforce was a fantastic experience. Aside from the technical skills and projects I worked on, Salesforce instilled in me lasting values, friendships, and habits. This internship was nothing short of a dream come true and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Looking back, I can see how much I've grown, and I am immensely grateful for this opportunity.

### Preparation resources:

Before applying for any internship/placement process, perform comprehensive research about the company inside and out. This involved delving into their core values, business model, and recent developments. By doing so, you can tailor your application to align with their culture and objectives, which plays a crucial role in securing the spot.

Another vital component of preparation is networking. Reached out to current or former interns and employees, seeking insights and advice. Their guidance will provide a unique perspective on what to expect during the interview process and the internship itself. 

For technical rounds and interviews, practice coding problems regularly, review data structures and algorithms, and seek feedback from peers and mentors. Most interviewers focus on coding skills, problem-solving aptitude, and the ability to work through technical challenges. Even if you code a problem correctly but fail to explain, it will leave a wrong impression on interviewers. I used Leetcode and Interviewbit to practice coding questions.

Talking about the HR round, Salesforce conducts proper HR interviews to assess cultural fit and soft skills. I prepared for these by reflecting on my experiences, identifying key achievements and challenges, and practicing how to communicate them effectively.

Lastly, I encourage you to stay in touch with your seniors, seek their guidance, and learn from their experiences. You can also reach out to me if you have any questions.
