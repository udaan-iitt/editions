In her debut novel, "[I Was, I Am](https://www.wattpad.com/story/49405751-i-was-i-am)," she introduces us to a group of childhood friends whose lives take unexpected turns, and it's a journey filled with "messy goodbyes" and "unfinished confrontations." But amidst the chaos, there's an undying passion for interior design that keeps our protagonist, Aditi, going. This story will take you on a ride filled with "drama," "unexpectedly blooming office romance," and the thrilling exploration of forgiveness and change.



"[Back to Back](https://www.wattpad.com/story/106709423-back-to-back)" is a story of serendipity and self-discovery, where two characters, Vedant and Meera, swap bags and embark on a life-changing journey. The author teases us with the idea that sometimes, all it takes is "a few crazy journal entries and an identical red Nike backpack" to realise what's been missing in our lives.



In the sequel, "[Back and Forth](https://www.wattpad.com/story/114409725-back-and-forth)," the author delves deeper into the complexities of love and self-discovery. Vedant finally meets Meera in person after a long wait, and the story promises to be a rollercoaster of emotions. The author cleverly reminds us that falling in love with someone's diary entries is an entirely different experience from falling in love with the person behind those words.



The final instalment, "[Back in Time](https://www.wattpad.com/story/131249967-back-in-time)," promises to be a fitting conclusion to the "Back to Back" series. The author tantalisingly suggests that love may have knocked on Vedant's door in the form of a red Nike backpack when he was just twenty. However, carrying each other's bags may not be enough, hinting at a deeper exploration of love and relationships.



And don't miss out on "[Unsaid, Undone](https://www.wattpad.com/story/187532332-unsaid-undone)," a captivating spin-off that navigates class differences, disapproving parents, and heartbreaking compromises. 



After this quick and not-so-subtle nudge from our end to check out all her works (you truly must check them out), it's time to sit back and enjoy a tea-time chat with the author herself, [Kimayaa-Ankita](https://www.wattpad.com/user/Kimayaa). As we explore her enchanting world of storytelling, we delve deeper into her inspirations, writing process, and the magic she infuses into her books.



So, grab a cup of tea, settle in, and get ready to connect with the brilliant mind behind these captivating stories. As we chat with the author herself, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the art of storytelling and the delightful world she has crafted within the pages of her books.



Every person has that one special motivator, that guiding star who nudges them to step into uncharted territory. For Ankita, that person is none other than her beloved sister. It's the sisterly bond, the unwavering support, and the constant encouragement that propelled Ankita to embark on her literary journey.



Ankita's sister, three years her senior, has been a lifelong role model. In her eyes, her sister comes remarkably close to perfection. This profound admiration has translated into a profound sense of gratitude, as every aspect of Ankita's life bears the mark of her sister's influence.



Her sister's unwavering support has extended to various facets of Ankita's life. From writing to pursuing career goals and even nurturing her love for singing, Ankita's sister has been the driving force behind her accomplishments. As we delve deeper into the world of Ankita, we'll keep in mind the incredible bond she shares with her sister and how it has infused her writing with a unique depth and authenticity. It's a heartwarming reminder that the most meaningful stories often draw inspiration from the people who hold a special place in our hearts.



But what about Ankita's journey to the world of Wattpad, where her tales truly began to take flight? It's a fascinating story in itself. At the tender age of 14, Ankita was already dabbling in writing. She would create stories on the family desktop, carefully hiding them in obscure folders, hoping they would remain hidden from prying eyes.



However, her secret world of words was uncovered when her sister stumbled upon one of her creations. The initial embarrassment and reluctance to share her work with others were palpable. But her sister, with unwavering belief, saw the potential in her writing. She encouraged Ankita to share her stories with the world, suggesting that others might enjoy them too.



Still hesitant, Ankita finally decided to give it a shot when her sister's voracious reader friend introduced her to Wattpad, the free platform where her tales could find a home. The allure of anonymity and the opportunity to connect with readers from around the world drew her in. Initially, she kept her identity hidden, but as she began to enjoy the interactions and connections with fellow writers and readers, she decided to embrace her newfound passion openly.\
And so, in 2015, Ankita embarked on her Wattpad journey, marking the beginning of her writing adventures in the digital realm. Her journey on Wattpad even came with a unique pen name, "Kimayaa," a name that she chose for its fanciful and distinctive sound, far removed from her everyday persona. She explains that the name Kimaya means "divine," and she thought it sounded very cool.



But how does Ankita, or rather Kimayaa, craft the intricate plots and stories that have captured the hearts of her readers? Her approach to storytelling is as unique as her pen name. She confesses that her mind doesn't work in a linear fashion when it comes to plotting. She might have a start, a middle, or an end in mind, but rarely the full circle. Ideas for plots flood her mind constantly, sometimes even in the midst of unrelated tasks like studying for exams.



It's these particular ideas, the ones that refuse to be ignored, that push her to put pen to paper. Ankita's process is organic; she starts writing when inspiration strikes, allowing her creativity to flow freely. Months may pass as she lets the characters and their stories evolve naturally within her mind. She acknowledges that she lacks a structured plan, unlike some of her Wattpad friends who meticulously outline their stories.



For Ankita, writing is an escape from the structured and demanding world of her professional life, where deadlines and responsibilities are the norm. Writing is her sanctuary, a place of unhurried creativity. She doesn't set specific chapter targets or make detailed notes; she simply follows the whims of her imagination. It's this relaxed and spontaneous approach that allows her to infuse her stories with an authentic and heartfelt quality.



Now, let's delve into the most captivating aspect, “the dashing heroes” —the characters that make readers swoon and set the bar high for any girl who encounters them within the pages of her novels. Ankita's process of creating these captivating male protagonists is as intriguing as the stories themselves.



It all begins with a simple yet profound concept—she channels her desires and yearnings for an ideal partner into these fictional heroes. Each hero is born from the emotions and aspirations that Ankita herself experiences in her life at the time of writing. It's almost as if she's pouring her own desires, hopes, and dreams into the characters, shaping them into the kind of individuals she longs for.



Take, for instance, Vedant Shah from "Back in Time." At the time Ankita crafted his character, she was going through a phase where she believed she had found someone who perfectly matched her ideal partner. However, as time passed, she discovered that this person wasn't the one. In this process, Ankita learned about the qualities she didn't want in a partner. And from these realisations, Vedant Shah emerged as the antithesis of what she didn't want. He became the embodiment of all the qualities and traits she yearned for in a partner.



Similarly, characters like Dev were shaped by Ankita's own experiences. When she was adjusting to a new school and wished for someone to be kind and supportive, Dev came to life as the friend she desired, providing not only emotional support but also practical help to ease her transition. These characters did for her protagonists what she wished someone had done for her in real life.



A side note from the author herself, “You should not wait for anyone to come and do that for you.”



Let's delve into another aspect of Ankita's storytelling, a theme that resonates deeply with Vedant's character and his journey in "Back in Time." This theme revolves around the so-called middle-class privilege, a concept Vedant grapples with as he charts his unique path.



Ankita's portrayal of Vedant's emotional struggle with this notion wasn't a deliberate choice. Instead, it emerged as a reflection of her upbringing. Growing up, Ankita was fortunate to be raised in a household where access to education and opportunities was viewed as an inherent right, not a privilege or a favour. It was the belief that every individual had the right to shape their life as they saw fit.



In many ways, Vedant's character embodies this outlook. He doesn't see himself as privileged in a negative light but rather as someone who has benefited from a supportive and positive environment that nurtured his growth. This perspective draws deeply from Ankita's own life experiences.



Transitioning to Ankita's personal connection with her characters, Vedant stands out as a character she profoundly admires and identifies with. Vedant epitomises balance—a character who seamlessly juggles family, career, and enduring love. Ankita draws inspiration from Vedant's unwavering determination, especially in the face of adversity. She particularly values his unwavering self-assuredness, a quality that remains unshaken even in situations where others might question their masculinity. Vedant represents a level of assurance in life that Ankita aspires to achieve.



Ankita's storytelling has indeed set a high standard for anyone who has delved into her books, particularly characters like Vedant, who transcend gender stereotypes. Ankita openly acknowledges that individuals like Vedant, with such a well-balanced belief system, are rare, especially among men her age.



In discussing this observation, Ankita offers her perspective on the world we live in, particularly in relation to men and their upbringing. She expresses concern that, despite harbouring no ill will toward men or boys, her personal experiences have often revealed a lack of sensitivity among them. Ankita observes that sensitivity often comes naturally to most women without the need for explicit teaching. However, she believes that men may require more direct communication and explicit expression of feelings, possibly due to evolutionary or cultural factors.



Yet, Ankita remains hopeful as she acknowledges that times are changing, with shifting societal roles and women increasingly taking on traditionally male roles. In this evolving landscape, Ankita expresses a wish for more men to become sensitive. She maintains that her belief in this regard has remained steadfast for many years—that, in general, men are less sensitive than women. However, she also emphasises the importance of not seeking a "ready-made package" and acknowledges that people, regardless of gender, evolve and grow over time.



However, not every character resonates equally with Ankita. Disha, for instance, is a character she finds less relatable. Disha's impulsive nature sharply contrasts with Ankita's thoughtful and meticulous approach to life, where she meticulously plans each step, considering multiple angles and possibilities.



Now, let's shift gears and explore another compelling aspect of Ankita's storytelling—a desire to redefine traditional gender roles, a theme particularly evident in the dynamics between Disha and Arjun.



This deep-seated conviction was rooted in a poignant incident from her school days, a time when she witnessed the pervasive influence of gender stereotypes on young minds. It was during a class discussion when the teacher was absent, and the students engaged in animated conversations. What Ankita heard from her fellow female classmates left her astonished and troubled. They openly discussed their willingness to sacrifice their careers for their future husbands, accepting it as the norm. Simultaneously, they expected the men not to make the same sacrifices.



This revelation deeply bothered Ankita, and she couldn't comprehend why such beliefs were ingrained in their minds. She challenged her peers, urging them to consider different perspectives and question these conventional norms. The incident left an indelible mark on her, igniting a desire for change.



Ankita realised that the power to challenge these norms and redefine gender roles lay within the realm of storytelling. Through her characters, she sought to break free from these stereotypes, offering them the autonomy to carve out their own destinies. Her writing became a platform to encourage readers to question and challenge societal expectations, just as she did during that memorable classroom discussion.



The above conversations seemed a little too focused on the Back to Back series; We can’t help it. The editors from Udaan love Vedant and wanted to know more, But it’s time  we shift our focus to her work "I Was, I Am." This story beautifully captures the theme of growing apart, and we were curious to know if it was inspired by real-life experiences.



Ankita shares that "I Was, I Am" is indeed loosely inspired by her own experiences, particularly related to moving between cities. She mentions that while she hasn't moved extensively, the frequent relocations she experienced due to changing schools left an impact. It led her to realise that when you change cities as a civilian as opposed to a military kid who might be a little more used to this, you often lose touch with people you once considered close friends. Despite promises and good intentions, life goes on, and everything becomes a part of history.



Ankita draws from a personal loss to illustrate her point. She had a close friend, with whom she shared what she considers the best seven years of her life. However, despite her assumption that they would always be friends, life took a different turn. Her friend passed away when they were both 15, and Ankita reflects on how this loss made her realise the impermanence of life. She understood that nothing in life is guaranteed to last forever, and people move on and change. Yet, there's no need for animosity or resentment; life simply continues.



Ankita's aim with "I Was, I Am" was to depict this gradual transition where people move on in life without any negative emotions. The story showcases the reality that friendships can naturally evolve, and you may meet these same friends after a few years and reminisce about the past without any drama or ill feelings.

Speaking of relationships and transitions, the topic of long-distance relationships came up during our conversation. We asked Ankita if she had ever considered an alternative storyline where Akash confesses his feelings before leaving, asking Aditi to wait for him. We were curious about how the story might have unfolded in such a scenario.



Ankita shared her thoughts on this hypothetical scenario. She believes that Aditi was quite smitten with Akash, so if he had confessed and asked her to wait, she likely would have. However, Ankita also recognises that long-distance relationships can be challenging due to the physical separation and the emotional void it can create. She acknowledges that Aditi might have developed feelings for Dev in Akash's absence. Despite some criticism she's seen for Aditi moving on despite Akash not confessing, Ankita emphasises that there's nothing inherently wrong with finding emotional support and connection with someone else when you're in a long-distance relationship, as long as it's based on communication and not cheating on your partner.



Ankita reflected on her writing journey and how it has evolved over time. She recalled a period when she felt compelled to keep up with her writing, even if it meant forcing herself to produce content, even when it didn't meet her personal satisfaction. However, as the years passed, she came to a significant realisation - she didn't want to publish content that she wasn't genuinely happy with. Unfortunately, due to her demanding work schedule over the past few years, she hasn't had the time to dedicate to her stories, leading to messages, comments, and DMs from readers wondering about her absence. Ankita wants to clarify that her absence isn't due to abandoning her stories but rather due to her lack of time.



Regarding the pressure to keep up with reader requests, Ankita admitted that she doesn't succumb to those demands anymore. As a child, the number of reads and reader engagement held significant importance to her. However, she has since realised that she won't compromise her mental health or well-being for the sake of popularity or engagement. She's observed many writers who started after her gaining more followers and readers, even becoming brand ambassadors, but she's comfortable with her approach and priorities.



When it comes to writer's block, Ankita shared her strategy - giving it time. She doesn't force herself to write when the inspiration isn't there. While some suggest simply starting to write, Ankita recognises that it's essential to respect the creative process and allow ideas to flow naturally. Ankita further explained her creative process, highlighting that she experiences either a strong urge to write with words flowing effortlessly or a complete absence of that feeling. There is no middle ground for her. When she doesn't have that inspiration, she takes it easy, allowing herself time to recharge creatively. One of her strategies for rekindling her creativity is to read other works. Reading books by other authors helps her get her mind back into the writing zone and find the inspiration she needs to continue her own storytelling journey. 



Ankita's journey on Wattpad has been marked by the ebb and flow of the community that surrounds it. She reminisces about a time in her late teens when the platform was teeming with Indian authors, creating an atmosphere of competition. The constant comparison of reading and book attention became a regular occurrence, albeit not always a healthy one. However, as time passed, she noticed a significant turnover, with many authors leaving the platform, realising that writing on Wattpad may not be their true calling.



In the end, those who remained formed a close-knit group of friends who supported and pushed each other to excel. They understood that Wattpad wasn't a full-time occupation but a passion they shared. They still exchange chapters, provide feedback, and have created a nurturing and positive environment. This shift towards a supportive community became a refreshing change from what Ankita was used to in other writing circles.



Family is the ultimate support system, and this stands true with Ankita as well. Her father stands out as a dedicated reader, although he prefers genres outside the realm of young adult romance. Nonetheless, he read "Pakhi" and became an enthusiastic advocate, encouraging his friends to read it as well. Her mother, on the other hand, isn't much of a reader, and Ankita humorously emphasises this point. While her mother may not delve into her stories, she patiently listens to Ankita's discussions about plots, characters, and narratives.



Ankita's sister has read all of her works. Beyond her immediate family, Ankita's cousins and friends have also been part of her journey. They have read her stories for various reasons, including support, constructive criticism, and even to help Ankita understand the source of occasional hate comments. These close connections have played a role in Ankita's growth as a writer, providing valuable insights and diverse perspectives.



With this, our tea-time chat comes to an end. It has been a pleasure sharing this literary journey with you exploring the depths of Ankita's creativity and inspiration.
