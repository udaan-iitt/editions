He is like the peoples president no? like how Dr Kalam was the people president everyone's best friend is ACCURATE?! I hope someone says he is a psychopath. What is his IQ you ask? is that what he is, if he was right, he'd really be better able to talk to you or hear you?"

The woman said she was unaware of her mother's last name. He had a long blond hair and long sleeves. She said the former secretary of state had the "wrong eye." I can confirm she told Trump that she'd been the president's chief speechwriter for 17 years. She said "it wasn't just talk, it was actual, real change."

Trump said she had the most respect for their relationship. She even told her mother that her boss had recently said he believed her. She described the women as "not being good friends or people at the White House." The meeting, which took place at Trump Tower on June 10 and 11, came six months after they met and six months after Trump's father, the late George W. Bush Sr., said he would accept the resignation of his son. Trump said he would not attend.

The woman told The Associated Press a man who has claimed to have attended Trump's Mar-a-Lago club also attended in December said he was not invited to the meeting.
