<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">Take a moment to read what I say,<br>
Because it might really help some day.<br>
Let’s take some time to sit back and relax,<br>
Hit the reverse gear and look back at our tracks.<br>
Whenever you are drowning in the ocean of self-doubt,<br>
Retrospecting about your glorious past helps pull yourself out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">You are what you are, for a reason you exist,<br>
How then, can you let existential doubt persist?<br>
The uncertain life ahead, should never be a source of worry,<br>
Absolutely no good has ever come from rushing through the present in a hurry!<br>
However, great benefits can be reaped by analyzing the past,<br>
Thinking about where you could go slow and where fast.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;align:center;">
Not only must our focus go on the things that went wrong,<br>
But also, we must appreciate the areas in which we are strong,<br>
Because strengths and weaknesses are an integral part of life,<br>
Inseparable as such, just like two sides of a knife,<br>
Hence I urge you to-<br>
Pause your life sometime, and look back,<br>
At all the achievements you have managed to stack,<br>
For the satisfaction you get will be truly amazing,<br>
So pause your life sometime, and take a look back,<br>
At all the problems you faced that you could crack,<br>
For the benefits you reap will be truly mesmerizing…</p>
