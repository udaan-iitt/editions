Dr Pramod K Nayar, a distinguished figure in the Department of English at the University of Hyderabad and the UNESCO Chair in Vulnerability Studies, graces us with his wisdom. His role as a member of the senate at IIT Tirupati adds a unique perspective to our dialogue. Join us as we recreate this engaging conversation, where you'll discover profound insights and captivating ideas.

Our journey commences with an exploration of the very essence of the Humanities and the motivations that led Dr Pramod Nayar to choose this fascinating field. Humanities, often described as the study of human culture, provides a lens through which we understand the intricacies of human experiences, history, and society. Let's delve into why Dr Nayar was drawn to this diverse and enriching discipline.

*"As an avid reader since childhood, I've found literary studies and humanities to be my gateway to understanding the intricacies of the world. Unlike disciplines such as the sciences, which often offer singular perspectives, humanities embraces a more wide-ranging and eclectic approach,"* Dr Pramod Nayar explained.

He further elaborated on humanities' unique perspective, stating that it is driven by a profound concern for questions of exclusion, social justice, and the impact of societal devices. According to Dr Nayar, while ethicists in the sciences and technology studies grapple with these issues, humanities delve deeper, not interested in the device per se but in what the device does to the social order. In the subfield of humanities, particularly literature—his area of expertise—the focus is on those who get included or excluded from the benefits of the world, whether in technology, finance, or government. According to Dr Nayar, this exploration isn't just a critique; it serves as a means to imagine alternatives, asserting that the world need not remain as it is. He emphasised that, unlike the hard sciences, which provide dry rules and cause-and-effect sequences to explain the world, humanities, and literature in particular, go beyond.

"*Humanities,*" he muses, "*is our compass in the labyrinth of the world. It’s about envisioning what the world ought to be.*" He encapsulates the essence of humanities as a continuous journey, an odyssey working towards the elusive 'democracy to come,' borrowing a phrase from Jacques Derrida.

In seeking insights tailored for our predominantly engineering-focused audience at IIT Tirupati, we posed the following question to Dr Nayar: "*Could you shed light on the significance of humanities and social sciences in addressing contemporary global challenges?*"

In response, Dr Nayar draws a compelling connection between the sciences and humanities. While science provides hard facts and statistics about issues such as climate change, the full understanding of consequences, especially on human life, comes from social sciences and humanities. Issues like climate justice, inherently abstract, find articulation within these disciplines. Dr Nayar underscores humanities' crucial role in exploring the ethical and social dimensions, completing the vision provided by scientific reports. He posits that humanities' unique capacity to delve into the experiences of outsiders, offering insights into diverse worlds, is instrumental in fostering understanding and empathy. Dr Nayar highlights the power of narratives to bridge gaps in understanding complex global challenges, emphasising, "*The novel keeps you engaged,*" underscoring the pivotal role of storytelling in navigating the intricate interplay between technology and the humanities.

While humanities hasn't always enjoyed the same level of reverence as other disciplines in Indian society, there has been a discernible shift in recent years, with the field gaining momentum. Against this backdrop, we sought Dr Pramod Nayar's perspective on the current state of humanities and social sciences in India, probing the challenges and opportunities that define these disciplines in the country.

Dr Nayar drew attention to the expanding horizons for professionals in humanities, highlighting a growing demand across various sectors. "*Graduates in humanities are increasingly venturing beyond traditional paths,*" he remarked. He discussed a rising trend where legal scholars and individuals from science backgrounds are integrating humanities perspectives into their work. This shift has paved the way for diverse career avenues, ranging from content writing and teaching to roles such as content advisors in companies. Notably, major players such as Deloitte have acknowledged the importance of a humanistic perspective and are actively hiring humanities graduates in fields like communications, mass media, and journalism. This wide array of opportunities underscores the relevance and applicability of humanities skills in the contemporary professional landscape.

Dear reader, before delving into our next line of inquiry, we'd like to shed light on Dr Pramod Nayar's extensive body of work. His writings encompass a rich tapestry of academic monographs, contributions to popular history, scholarly book reviews, essays in esteemed journals, and over three hundred pieces in newspapers and periodicals across India. Notably, his bylines grace publications such as The Wire, Telangana Today, Hindu Business Line, Deccan Chronicle, Daily News and Analysis, and Deccan Herald.

Dr Nayar's scholarly contributions extend further with approximately 130 research articles published in distinguished journals like Modern Fiction Studies, English Language Notes, Journal of Early Modern Cultural Studies, Narrative, Asiatic, Commonwealth: Essays and Studies, and several other scholarly platforms which can be further explored on his [personal website](https://sites.google.com/site/pramodknayar/Home).

Against this backdrop, we now turn our attention to Dr Nayar's multifaceted research, which spans diverse topics. The question that naturally arises is how these seemingly disparate areas intersect in his work and what insights he discerns from this eclectic mix.

Dr Nayar explains, "*Our UNESCO Chair's focus revolves around 'vulnerable lives and the vulnerable planet,' which initially led me to explore human rights and literature.*" This exploration extends to diverse areas, including the study of graphic novels and extreme cultures.

His current research unfolds in the historical realm of British India (1770 to 1905), examining famines, floods, and earthquakes not just as natural disasters but as triggers for profound human consequences. Dr Nayar is also interested in contemporary literature's reflections on technology's impact, particularly posthumanism's exploration of genetic engineering, cloning, and bio-enhancement. Drawing examples from novels like Never Let Me Go, he highlighted these technologies' ethical and moral dimensions, pondering the consequences of what he terms "*runaway technologies.*"

In his investigations of the future, Dr Nayar spoke of scenarios where the state and corporations merge to control technology, leaving individuals marginalised. He raises critical questions about the ethical implications of treating robots as servants, drawing parallels with historical discussions and robot servitude. Through his work, he seeks to unravel the complexities of these issues and propose potential solutions for navigating the challenges presented by evolving technologies and societal structures.

Dr Pramod Nayar currently holds the prestigious position of the UNESCO Chair in Vulnerability Studies. The Chair aims to advance knowledge and practice in areas of connected with  UNESCO’s priority list embodied in its SDGs. In light of this context, we inquired about Dr Pramod Nayar's path to securing the role of UNESCO Chair in Vulnerability Studies. Additionally, we sought a comprehensive explanation of the fundamental responsibilities and activities integral to this esteemed position.

“*Well, it takes a lot of work to get there.*” he chuckled. 

His exploration, culminating in three human rights books, two literature books, and a graphic novel, stems from a philosophical and political question: defining the human before and in human rights. This quest found its natural home in literary studies, leading to a series of impactful publications from 2012, all converging on the study of vulnerable lives, social justice, and the essence of humanity. 

Dr Nayar's distinctive approach clearly resonated for UNESCO, standing out for its focus on the study of vulnerability. He detailed the UNESCO Chair's mandate, underscoring its role as a teaching and research unit, distinguishing it from activist chairs that engage in grassroots work. Notably, three MA elective courses in Vulnerability Studies have been run, one introducing the subject and another delving into 'Vulnerable Lives in British India' and one on Vulnerability in the Early Modern period taught by Professor Anna Kurian, Faculty Fellow, UNESCO Chair in Vulnerability Studies in the same Department.  

The UNESCO chair's impact extends through various activities. Dr Nayar highlighted a series of talks on drawing vulnerability, featuring artists who contributed to the "*Famine Tales*" graphic novel collection, addressing the 1770 Bengal famine. A theoretical roundtable on conceptualising vulnerability was also conducted, involving experts like Scott Slovic, Winifred Poster and Lisa Diedrich in environmental humanities, sociology and labour studies, and the sociology of medicine. A national seminar on Vulnerability in Urdu Literature was organized by Dr Zahidul Haque of the Department of Urdu, UoH, and a Faculty Fellow, UNESCO Chair in Vulnerability Studies, bringing together historians, literary studies scholars and others in a pioneering seminar. 

The teaching component spans courses, talks, and workshops, including a recent one at GITAM University. Simultaneously, the Chair’s research culminates in upcoming publications such as the book Vulnerable Earth from Cambridge University Press, exploring the literature of climate crisis. In 2023, he published a book on nuclear cultures, scrutinising films and literature around Trinity, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, addressing planetary precarity.

Public journalism is another facet of the chair’s engagement, with numerous pieces written in newspapers, Dr Nayar highlighted that over the past six months, he has published articles on Nazi Germany, intertwining historical concerns with contemporary issues like eroded democracies, justice for minorities, and hate speech. 

Oo... that's a lot of work. Continuing the narrative, we asked him what gives him simple happiness amidst his very busy and focused life, and well, you shouldn’t be surprised by his answer.

"*That's exactly what gives me happiness. Having a very busy, focused life. Writing and teaching.*"

Dr Nayar emphasizes the continuous nature of a teacher's job, transcending boundaries and zones for those willing to listen. Reflecting on the diversity of students across the country, he notes a deep interest in learning, though hindered by various structural conditions.

His satisfaction stems from the realisation that he can genuinely assist someone in developing their thinking abilities through teaching. Dr Nayar acknowledges the challenges and opportunities in guiding students, expressing, "*It does give me quite a bit of satisfaction to see that you can actually help somebody think.*"

He places particular importance on not moulding students to think in certain predefined ways but instead shaping the methodology of their thinking. For him, the emphasis lies in the process of arriving at conclusions rather than the conclusions themselves. Dr Nayar elucidates, "*It's not what they think, but how they think that is important.*" This philosophy resonates deeply, especially in literary studies, where the focus is on teaching students how to imagine, speculate, and make connections.

Quoting E.M. Foster, he underscores the fundamental principle: "*Only connect.*" Making connections, fostering imagination, and encouraging speculative thinking are the cornerstones of his teaching philosophy. Dr Nayar finds intrinsic satisfaction in witnessing students navigate this process, even if their conclusions diverge from his expectations.

In delving deeper into Dr Nayar's diverse contributions, it's crucial to explore his extensive involvement in the realm of graphic novels and comics.  This prompts the following question, ‘Sir, you have published a lot of graphic novels and comics. So, how do you see these visual narratives adding to the whole aspect of literary studies?’

"*In the realm of graphic novels, I haven't authored but rather published critical work on them,*" clarifies Dr Nayar. He elaborates, "*It introduces a novel dimension to our engagement with literature, resembling the experience of watching a film while simultaneously reading subtitles.*" Stressing the need for critical literacy, he notes how this combination of verbal and visual elements demands heightened attentiveness from readers, offering a distinct experience compared to traditional print journals. Furthermore, he highlights the efficiency of graphic novels in conveying powerful messages with minimal text, often surpassing the impact of lengthy descriptions. In a nod to the contemporary visual-centric generation, he accentuates the significance of visual culture in graphic novels. The appeal lies in its ability to resonate with a generation accustomed to processing information mainly through images and icons. In a world where recognition often precedes reading, the visual richness of graphic novels aligns seamlessly with the preferences of this visually dominated era.

In a time that often emphasizes moving on, letting go, and leaving the past behind, we inquired about the pertinence of postcolonial literature and theory in the present day. Specifically, we questioned whether these concepts genuinely contribute to addressing and resolving contemporary issues. Dr Nayar’s answer is truly something.

"*Literature doesn't necessarily solve problems; it alerts us to the problems at hand. For instance, postcolonial novels from Africa or India shed light on the idea that events like floods or starvation are not merely natural disasters but are man-made, resulting from a collusion between the state and corporate greed. These works reveal the implications of government policies and profit-driven corporate actions, emphasizing their impact on people. Contemporary literature enables us to examine the ongoing legacy of the colonial period, revealing how societies have perpetuated practices inherited from their colonial past.*

*Furthermore, it brings attention to the postcolonial state's adoption of oppressive roles similar to those of their colonial predecessors. Matters of social justice, equity, and the environment take a back seat to power dynamics, mirroring the colonial state's priorities. The alliance between the state and corporate entities becomes a perilous force, as depicted in numerous postcolonial novels that serve as warnings about the state of the world.*"

Seeking insights into Dr Nayar's work, we probed specific domains, beginning with his exploration of ‘Women in Colonial India.’ Our curiosity extended to understanding the ideas embedded in this work and how they resonate with contemporary realities.

"*‘Women in Colonial India’ is a treasure trove of primary documents across five volumes. These documents are British responses to critical issues like female infanticide, sati, and the age of consent for marriage.*

*These historical records go beyond British perspectives, offering insights into how Indians themselves treated women. For instance, in Katiawar, upper-class families practised female infanticide, which prompted British intervention. The British were tasked with ensuring the survival of these daughters, even resorting to financial incentives for families.*”

"*Although not a direct blueprint for the present, this historical narrative provides valuable insights into the cultural history of the subcontinent,*" Dr Nayar emphasized.

"*Connecting historical practices to contemporary debates, we see that while societal structures have evolved, certain ideologies and discourses persist,*" he asserted. "*Exploring the evolution of Zanana in the 18th century, we observe the modification of attitudes towards women over time,*" he continued. "*The deep-seated influences of the caste system, patriarchal norms, and religious identities continue to shape societal conditions, impacting education and opportunities.*"

With his extensive academic and journalistic writing background, Dr Nayar brings a unique perspective to the intersection of these two realms. As we converse, he sheds light on a crucial aspect: the fundamental difference in addressing a general audience versus a more scholarly readership. 

"*Journalism necessitates presenting arguments in a language that garners acceptance. While valid, theoretical and rigorous arguments about contemporary or popular culture cannot be inundated with 302 footnotes and parenthetical references—nobody reads that,*" Dr Nayar emphasises. "*That's one, the language.*"

He continues, "*The second challenge lies in a certain loss of nuance and fine-tuning due to the constraints of word limits in journalism. While platforms like WIRE have allowed for 2,500-word essays, there remains a restriction on the freedom to write expansively. That's the second hurdle.*"

Dr Nayar moves on, stating, "*The third aspect involves making historical accounts and comparisons catchy and appealing. Deeply nuanced anecdotes about obscure topics have to possess a certain market value. What's crucial here is that arguments presented in rigorous scholarly essays, even if read by a limited audience, can be effectively translated into journalism, reaching a larger and more diverse readership. Specialised journal articles are typically read by a handful, but in journalism, more people engage. I receive feedback from various individuals, including a 90-year-old who appreciates discussions about Paris in the poetry of Baudelaire. It's heartening to see that my points resonate across diverse age groups and backgrounds.*"

Speaking of Dr Nayar's relationship with and views on academic and journalistic writing unveils a concept he terms the '*doomed university.*' Coined in one of his WIRE articles, this term reflects struggling public institutions in India within the broader public university system. These universities play a vital role in providing education to a substantial portion of the Indian population, with 95% to 98% benefitting from their subsidised and accessible programs. Dr Nayar emphasizes the critical need to defend these public institutions, considering their historical significance in offering education to the majority.

The term doomed universities encapsulates the notion that these institutions are gradually losing autonomy and grappling with financial constraints. Dr Nayar raises concerns about the dwindling number of teachers, financial challenges, and an increasing reliance on contract-based faculty. Additionally, he underscores potential repercussions, including a deterioration in the quality of education, restricted access for students, and the migration of qualified individuals to the private sector due to job scarcity and politicisation. An issue we also believe requires immediate attention.

When we delved into the prevalent narrative that the history taught during our formative years contributes to an inherent inferiority complex, Dr Nayar presented a compelling alternative viewpoint.

He dismantles the notion that history is a unidimensional force, asserting, "*History is never unidimensional. There are multiple angles to this.*" Dr Nayar challenges the simplistic categorisation of governments as purely good or evil, stating, "*No government is all evil or all good.*" Critiquing the political agenda behind framing history as a source of inferiority, he contends, "*This argument that history makes us feel inferior serves a particular political purpose.*"

Dr Nayar underscores the pitfalls of oversimplified classifications: "*You can identify certain categories of people as invaders, outsiders, foreigners, strangers. Others apparently are all good natives. But that is simply not true.*" Emphasizing the crucial role of diverse perspectives in education, he notes, "*History, how we teach it, will determine how we start looking at our neighbours.*"

Addressing historical omissions, he questions, "*Why would we not teach reform systems by Iyothi Das or Ambedkar's arguments against even Gandhi?*" Dr Nayar advocates the inclusion of counter-movements and disagreements in history education, declaring, "*Intersections and disagreements exist. And if you don't teach the disagreements, we assume that there are only two categories of people: us and them. But that is not how history has operated. We need history in all its complexity to be taught from very early stages. So that we enable our students, children, and the next generations to understand that history was messy; there were disagreements, there were quarrels, and there were consensus, consensus-building operations, and agreements as well. This is very important.*" 

As we approached the conclusion of our enlightening conversation, we sought Dr Nayar's insights on IIT Tirupati.

“*It's truly a remarkable place. Contrary to my expectations that it was still functioning from a transit campus, I discovered it is already well-established, and that's impressive. What excites me most is the enthusiasm I've observed in the research scholars I've interacted with. They seem genuinely eager to learn, at least at this current juncture. While the future remains uncertain, there's a sense of hope. The location itself is strategically advantageous, with connections to Hyderabad, Chennai, and other key places.*

*I see tremendous potential for the growth of humanities here. My optimism extends to the prospect of humanities intersecting with the science and engineering disciplines on campus, giving rise to engaging interdisciplinary courses and conversations. I find it particularly encouraging that engineering students like yourself actively engage with people and take humanities courses. If such initiatives can be formalised, allowing students from different disciplines to participate in each other's courses, it could lead to a dynamic and enriching environment. I believe IIT Tirupati, being in its nascent stages, has the opportunity to foster these collaborations.*

*Looking ahead, I hope to witness increased student enthusiasm in designing and implementing interdisciplinary programs. I've suggested the idea of organising workshops that attract students from other universities, fostering the creation of networks. Furthermore, the proposal for a humanities study circle, potentially expanding to include participants from other institutions through online platforms, is a testament to the boundless potential for growth and collaboration.*”

Concluding on this positive and thought-provoking note, we express our heartfelt gratitude to Dr Nayar for his insightful interview. Our sincere appreciation extends to the Humanities and Social Sciences Department at IIT Tirupati for their invaluable support in making this conversation possible. Special thanks are owed to Prof. Raghuramraju and Aiswarya Pradeep for their assistance and encouragement.

The presence of Dr Nayar in the Senate is undoubtedly a great asset to IIT Tirupati, and we look forward with eagerness to the institution's continued ascent under his guidance. Here's to reaching new heights and fostering further collaborations in the pursuit of academic excellence.
